    <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
    <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
    <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
    <IPAR>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
      <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
      <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
      <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
      <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
    </IPAR>
    <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
      <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
      <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
      <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

      <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="viii"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">OBSOLETE PROVISIONS</HD>
      <P>Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 1986, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES</HD>

      <P>A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR <E T="04">Index and Finding Aids.</E> This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.</P>
      <P>An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.</P>
      <P>The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.</P>
      <P>A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL</HD>
      <P>There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The following regulations implement Executive Order 12356 and provide guidance for members of the public desiring a review for declassification of a document of the Peace Corps.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 301.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Requests for mandatory declassification review.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) All information originally classified by the Peace Corps shall be subject to review for declassification.</P>
          <P>(b) Requests for review of such information for declassification shall be in writing, addressed to the Peace Corps Director of Security, Peace Corps, Washington, DC 20526, and reasonably describe the information sought with sufficient specificity to enable its location with a reasonable amount of effort. Only requests made by a United States citizen or a permanent resident alien, a Federal agency or a State or local government will be considered.</P>
          <P>(c) Requests relating to information, either derivatively classified by the Peace Corps or originally classified by another agency but in the possession of the Peace Corps, shall be forwarded, together with a copy of the record, to the originating agency. The transmittal may contain in Peace Corps recommendation for action.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 301.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Action on requests for declassification review.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Director of Security shall present each request for declassification to the Peace Corps Classification Review Committee, which shall consist of the Associate Director for International Operations, the Associate Director for Management and the General Counsel, or their designees, together with his or her recommendation for action.</P>
          <P>(b) Every effort will be made to complete action on each request within 60 days of receipt thereof.</P>
          <P>(c) Information shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. If the Classification Review Committee determines that the material for which review is requested no longer requires this protection, it shall be declassified and made available to the requester unless withholding is otherwise authorized by law.</P>
          <P>(d) If the Peace Corps Classification Review Committee determines that requested information must remain classified, the requester shall be given prompt notice of the decision and, if possible, a brief explanation of why the information cannot be declassified.</P>
          <P>(e) The Peace Corps may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of requested information whenever the fact of its existence or non-existence is itself classified under E.O. 12356.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Records</E> includes all books, papers, maps, photographs, films, tapes, or other documentary material or copies thereof, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made in or received by the Peace Corps and preserved as evidence of its organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or other activities but does not include books, magazines, or other materials acquired solely for library purposes and available in the library of the agency.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Identifiable</E> means, in the context of a request for a record, one which is reasonably described in a manner sufficient to permit the location of the material requested.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Unit</E> means an office of the Agency headed by a senior official who shall be responsible for making initial determinations of availability of documents or records requested hereunder.

At present, the units of the Agency for the purposes hereof consist of, the Office of the Director; the Executive Secretariat; the Office of Private Sector Development; the Office of Executive Talent Search; the Office of General Counsel and Legislative Liaison; the Office of Public Affairs; the Office of the Associate Director for Marketing, Recruitment, Placement and Staging; the Office of the Associate Director for International Operations; and the Office of the Associate Director for Management.</P>

The Agency deems further publication of such index in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> both unnecessary and impractical.</P>
          <P>(e) To the extent necessary to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the Agency may delete identifying details from materials furnished under this section.</P>
          <P>(f) Brochures, flyers and other similar material shall be furnished to the extent that same are available. Copies of any such brochures and flyers which are out of print shall be furnished upon request at the cost of duplication, provided, however, that in the event no copy exists, the Agency shall not be responsible for reprinting the same.</P>
          <P>(g) The Agency will not be required to create or compile selected items from its file and records or to provide a requester with statistical or other data unless such data has been compiled by the Agency and is available in the form of a record in which event such record shall be made available as provided in this part.</P>

          <P>All records of the Peace Corps, in addition to those ordinarily maintained and disseminated under § 303.3 hereof, requested under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and reasonably described in any request therefore shall be made promptly available upon request of any member of the public for inspection or copying upon compliance with procedures established in this part, except to the extent that a determination is made, in accord with the procedures set forth herein, that a record is exempt from disclosure, and should be withheld in the public interest. All publications and other documents heretofore provided by the Peace Corps in the normal course of business will continue to be made available upon request to the appropriate unit of the Agency. No charge will be made for such documents unless necessary by reason of the fact that such document is no longer in print in which case the charge shall not exceed the cost of duplication as set forth herein.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 303.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Records which may be exempt from disclosure.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The following categories are examples of records maintained by the Peace Corps which, under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b), may be exempted from disclosure:</P>
          <P>(a) Records required to be withheld under criteria established by an Executive Order in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which are in fact properly classified pursuant to any such Executive Order. Included in this category are records required by Executive Order No. 12356, as amended, to be classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.</P>
          <P>(b) Records related solely to internal personnel rules and practices. Included in this category are internal rules and regulations relating to personnel management and operations which cannot be disclosed to the public without substantial prejudice to the effective performance of a significant function of the Agency.</P>
          <P>(c) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.</P>
          <P>(d) Information of a commercial or financial nature including trade secrets given in confidence. Included in this category are records containing commercial or financial information obtained from any person and customarily regarded as privileged and confidential by the person from whom they were obtained.</P>

          <P>(1) It is the policy of the Peace Corps not to release information which is a trade secret, or commercial or financial information which was obtained from a person and is privileged or confidential within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). It is also the policy of the Peace Corps to give submitters of <PRTPAGE P="10"/>information which may be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) adequate opportunity to provide information at the administrative level which may establish such exemption.</P>
          <P>(2) A person submitting information to the Peace Corps, if previously notified by the Peace Corps of his/her right to request confidential treatment for information, must request that the information be considered exempt from disclosure at the time of submission. Failure to do so will be deemed an acknowledgment that the submitter does not wish to claim exempt status.</P>
          <P>(3) A person submitting information not covered by paragraph (d)(2) of this section which is the subject of a Freedom of Information Request, and which may be exempt from disclosure, shall be given prompt written notification of such request, unless it can be established that the information should not be disclosed, or that the information has already been lawfully published or made available to the public. Such notice must afford submitters at least ten working days in which to object to the disclosure of any requested information.</P>
          <P>(4) Each request for exemption from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) as a trade secret or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information must:</P>
          <P>(i) Specifically identify the exact material claimed to be confidential.</P>
          <P>(ii) State whether or not the information identified has ever been released to a person not in a confidential relationship with the submitter.</P>
          <P>(iii) State the basis for submitter's belief that the information is not commonly known or readily ascertainable by outside persons.</P>
          <P>(iv) State how release of the information would cause harm to the submitter's competitive position.</P>
          <P>(5) The agency will not normally decide whether material received with a request for exemption from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) is entitled to be withheld unless a request for disclosure is made. Any reasonably segregable portion of a record will be disclosed after deletion of any portions determined to be exempt.</P>
          <P>(6) The agency will give careful consideration to all specified grounds for exemption prior to making its administrative determination and, in all cases in which the determination is to disclose, provide the submitter with a statement of the reasons why its disclosure objection was not sustained. The Peace Corps will provide the submitter with at lest ten days advance notice of the proposed release date of information in cases in which an objection to disclosure has been rejected.</P>
          <P>(7) The Peace Corps will notify the submitter promptly of any instance in which a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of its information. Submitters should not request exemption from disclosure unless they are prepared to assist the agency in the defense of any judicial proceeeding brought to compel disclosure.</P>
          <P>(e) Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not ordinarily be available by law to a party in litigation with the Agency. Included in this category are memoranda, letters, interagency and intra-agency communications and internal drafts, opinions and interpretations prepared by staff or consultants and records of deliberations of staff, ordinarily used in arriving at policy determinations and decisions.</P>
          <P>(f) Personnel, medical and similar files. Included in this category are personnel and medical information files of staff, volunteer applicants, former and current trainees/volunteers, lists of names and home addresses and other files or material containing private or personal information, the disclosure of which would amount to a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of any person to whom the information pertains.</P>

          <P>(g) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes. Included in this category are files compiled for the enforcement of all laws, or prepared in connection with government litigation and adjudicative proceedings; provided however, that such records shall be made available to the extent that their production will not (1) interfere with enforcement proceedings; (2) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication; (3) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (4) disclose the identity of a confidential source, <PRTPAGE P="11"/>and in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source; (5) disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or (6) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.</P>
          <P>(h) In the event any document or record requested hereunder shall contain material which is exempt from disclosure under this section, any reasonably segregable portion of such record shall, notwithstanding such fact, and to the extent feasible, be provided to any person requesting same, after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this section.</P>
          <P>(i) Documents or records determined to be exempt from disclosure hereunder may nonetheless be provided upon request in the event it is determined that the provision of such document would not violate the public interest or the right of any person to whom such information might pertain, and that disclosure is not prohibited by law or executive order.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Manner of requesting records—appeals.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Requests under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) for access to Peace Corps records may be filed in person or by mail with the Director of Administrative Services, Peace Corps, 806 Connecticut Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20526. All requests and the envelope in which they are sent must be plainly marked “FOIA Request.” Personal written requests will be received from between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except for official holidays. FOIA requests and appeals shall be deemed received when actually received by the Director of Administrative Services.</P>
          <P>(b) Requested records which are reasonably described shall either be made available within ten working days after receipt of any such request or a written notice that the request cannot be complied with will be provided to the person making such request within such ten day period. Any such notice of inability to comply shall specify the reasons for refusal and the right of the person making such request to appeal such adverse determination. In the event a request for a record or document is made to the Director of Administrative Services, and such office does not have the requested material, the requester shall be immediately notified.</P>
          <P>(c) Upon receipt of a notice of failure to comply, a person making a request for information, records, or documents may, within 15 calendar days from the receipt of such notice, appeal such adverse determination to the Director of the Peace Corps or designee. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall specify the date upon which the notice of failure or refusal to comply was received by the person making such request. The Director or designee shall make a determination with respect to such appeal within 20 working days after receipt of such appeal. Notice of such determination shall be provided in writing to the person making the request. If the original denial of the request for records is upheld in whole or in part, such notice shall include notification of the right of the person making such request to have judicial review of the denial and appeal as provided under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).</P>
          <P>(d) The time limits specified above for initial compliance, and appeal from a refusal to comply, may be extended by the Agency upon written notice to the person making the request. Such notice shall set forth the reasons for such extension and the date upon which determination is expected. Such extension may be applied at either the initial stage or the appellate stage, or both, provided that the aggregate of such extensions shall not exceed ten working days. Circumstances justifying an extension will include the following:</P>
          <P>(1) Time necessary to search and collect requested records from segments of the Agency separate from the office processing the request;</P>

          <P>(2) Time necessary to search, collect and appropriately examine a voluminous number of records demanded in a single request; or<PRTPAGE P="12"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) Time necessary for consultation with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more components of the agency which have an interest in the subject matter of the request.</P>
          <P>(e) The time limits provided in this section are mandatory and a person requesting records shall be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies with respect to such request in the event the Agency fails to comply within the said applicable time limit provisions as extended in accord with this section. In unusual circumstances in which additional time is necessary to collect and review the records requested, the Act provides that a court of appropriate jurisdiction may allow the agency additional time for such purpose. Alternatively, the Agency and the person making such request may agree as to a reasonable time for completion of Agency work upon such request.</P>
          <P>(f) Any notification of denial of any request for records under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of the persons primarily responsible for the denial of such request.</P>
          <P>(g) Upon receipt of a request for a record or document the Director of the Office of Administrative Services will promptly make an initial determination as to whether the request for the record reasonably describes such record with sufficient specificity to detemine the unit of the Agency to which such request should be referred. Upon making such initial determination, he shall immediately refer such request to the head of the unit concerned. Upon receipt of the request the head of the unit shall promptly determine whether the description of the record contained in the request is sufficient to permit its identification and production.</P>
          <P>(h) If the Director of Administrative Services or the head of the unit concerned determines that the description contained in the request is not sufficient to reasonably describe the record requested, the requester shall be so advised and shall be permitted to amend the request to provide any additional information which would better identify the record. The requester shall be provided with appropriate assistance from the head of the unit concerned, the Director of Administrative Services or any member of their staffs. A request which is amended in accord herewith shall be deemed to have been received by the Agency on the date of receipt of the amended request.</P>
          <P>(i) If the head of the unit concerned determines that the record requested is reasonably described so as to permit its identification, he or she shall make it available unless he or she determines, after consultation with the General Counsel, that (1) the record is exempt from disclosure and (2) it should be withheld in the public interest or to protect the rights of persons to whom the information pertains. When such a determination is made the requester shall be immediately notified in writing as provided herein.</P>
          <P>(j) Peace Corps offices overseas are not responsible for maintenance of Freedom of Information Act indexes, documents, or records (other than materials normally kept and maintained in such offices). FOIA requests received by overseas employees are to be forwarded to the Director, Office of Administrative Services, for processing. Such a request shall be considered received when actually received by the Director of Administrative Services.</P>
          <P>(k) The Peace Corps maintains recruiting offices in many states. These offices are not responsible for maintaining Freedom of Information Act indexes, reading rooms, or other records or documents. Requests to any Recruiting Office or Service Center Office for materials not given out in the normal course of business shall be referred to the Director of Administrative Services. The request shall be in writing and shall be deemed received when actually received by the Director of Administrative Services.</P>

          <P>The Agency will maintain a central records room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. The headquarters of the Peace Corps is presently located at 806 Connecticut Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.

          <SUBJECT>Identification of records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In order for the Agency to locate records and make them available it is necessary that it be able to identify the specific records sought. Persons wishing to inspect or secure copies of records should therefore seek to describe and identify them as fully and as accurately as possible. In cases where requests are submitted which are not sufficient to permit identification, the officer receiving the request will endeavor to assist the person seeking the records in filling in necessary details.</P>
          <P>(b) Among the kinds of information which a person seeking records should try to provide in order to permit an identification of a record are the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The unit or program of the Agency which may be responsible for or may have produced the record.</P>
          <P>(2) The specific event or action, if any, and if known, to which the record refers.</P>

          <P>(4) The type of record, such as an application, a contract, or a report.</P>
          <P>(5) Personnel of the office who may have prepared or have knowledge of the record.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Schedule of fees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> It is the policy of the Peace Corps to encourage the widest possible distribution of information concerning programs under its jurisdiction. To the extent practicable, this policy will be applied under this part so as to permit requests for inspection or copies of records to be met without substantial cost to the person making the request. Search and reproduction charges will be made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. On a case-by-case basis, the Peace Corps will conduct a thorough review of all fee waiver requests and will grant waivers of reductions in fees only in those cases in which the requester establishes that the disclosure of the information will primarily benefit the general public. The Agency shall charge fees that recoup the full direct costs incurred. The most efficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for documents made under the FOIA shall be used. <PRTPAGE P="14"/>When documents that would be responsive to a request are maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-based fee schedule programs, the Agency shall inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain records from those sources.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The Agency adopts the following definitions contained in OMB's “Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines,” that relate to this section:</P>
          <P>(1) The term <E T="03">direct costs</E> means those expenditures which an agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to an FOIA request.</P>
          <P>(2) The term <E T="03">search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents.</P>
          <P>(3) The term <E T="03">duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.</P>
          <P>(4) The term <E T="03">review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for a commercial use to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
          <P>(5) The term <E T="03"> ‘commercial use’ request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.</P>
          <P>(6) The term <E T="03">educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
          <P>(7) The term <E T="03">non-commercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (b)(5) of this section and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>(8) The term <E T="03">representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who made their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of freelance journalists, they will be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Agency will also look to the past publication record of a requester in making a determination.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees to be charged—</E>(1) <E T="03">Manual searches for records.</E> Whenever feasible, the Agency will charge at the salary rate(s) (i.e. basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making the search. However, where a homogeneous class of personnel is used exclusively (e.g., all administrative/clerical, or all professional/executive), the Agency may establish an average rate for the range of grades typically involved.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer searches for records.</E> The Agency will charge at the actual direct cost of providing the service. This will <PRTPAGE P="15"/>include the cost of operating the central processing unit (CPU) for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records responsive to an FOIA request and operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. When the Agency can establish a reasonable Agency-wide average rate for CPU operating costs and operator/programmer salaries involved in FOIA searches, it may do so and charge accordingly.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use will be charged for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges shall be assessed only for the initial review; i.e., the review undertaken the first time the Agency analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. The Agency will not charge for review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied. However, if records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply are reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered, the cost for such a subsequent review is properly assessable. Where a single class of reviewers is typically involved in the review process, the Agency may establish a reasonable Agency-wide average and charge accordingly.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Duplication of records.</E> The charge for paper copy reproduction of documents as of the date of publication is three cents per page. This charge represents the average Agency-wide direct cost of making such copies, taking into account the salary of the operators as well as the cost of the reproduction machinery. The rate shall be adjusted annually. Current rates may be requested from the Director, Office of Administrative Services. For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the Agency will charge the actual cost, including operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For other methods of reproduction or duplication, the Agency will charge the actual direct costs of producing the document or documents.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> (i) The Agency shall recover the full cost of certifying that records are true copies. The Agency will charge the salary rate(s) (i.e. basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) certifying the records. (ii) The Agency shall recover the full cost of sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc. The Agency shall not furnish the records until payment for such service has been received by the Agency. The Agency is not required to comply with requests for special mailing services.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Restrictions on assessing fees.</E> (i) With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, the Agency will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time without charge. The Agency will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. Except for commercial use requesters, the Agency will not begin to assess fees until after the free search and reproduction services have been provided.</P>
          <P>(ii) The elements to be considered in determining the “cost of collecting a fee,” are the administrative costs to the Agency of receiving and recording a requester's remittance, and processing the fee for deposit in the Treasury Department's special account. The per-transaction cost to the Treasury to handle such remittance will not be considered in the Agency's determination.</P>
          <P>(iii) For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the word “pages” refers to paper copies of a standard agency size which will normally be -“8<FR>1/2</FR> x 11” or “11 by 14.”</P>
          <P>(iv) The term <E T="03">search time</E> in this context means manual search. To apply this term to searches made by computer, the Agency will determine the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent. When the cost of the search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., the operator, the Agency will begin assessing charges for computer search. <PRTPAGE P="16"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of Cost.</E> (1) A request for documents must state that the requester will pay any or all reasonably necessary costs, or costs up to an amount specified in such request. If the head of the unit or the Director of Administrative Services determines that the anticipated cost for search and duplication of the records requested will be in excess of $25, or in excess of the limit specified in the request, the Director of Administrative Services shall advise the requester promptly after receipt of the initial request. Such notification shall specify the anticipated cost of search and reproduction of the records requested. The requester may thereafter amend his or her request to specify fewer documents or agree to accept the estimate of anticipated costs, in which case the request shall be deemed received by the Agency upon the receipt date of the requester's response. A requester may, prior to making a request, ask for an estimate of cost from the Director of Administrative Services who shall promptly respond to such request.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Method of Payment.</E> Payment shall be sent or delivered to the Collections Officer, Accounting Division. Such payment must be by check or money order payable to Peace Corps—FOIA. A receipt for fees shall be provided upon request.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Fees to be Charged—Categories of requesters.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these categories:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> The Agency will assess charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought for commercial use. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.</E> The Agency will provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Requesters who are representatives of the news media.</E> The Agency will provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the definition described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> Requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above will be charged fees which recover the full direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time will be furnished without charge. Requests from individuals for records about themselves filed in the Agency's systems of records will continue to be treated under the fee provisions published in the Agency's Privacy Act regulations (22 CFR part 308).</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiving or Reducing Fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Agency will furnish documents without charge or at reduced charges if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. A requester may, in his or her original request, or subsequently, ask for a fee waiver or that documents be furnished at a reduced charge. A request for documents shall not be deemed to have been received until a determination of the question of fee waiver or reduction has been <PRTPAGE P="17"/>made, provided however, that such determination shall be made within five working days from the receipt of a fee waiver request. A request for waiver or reduction of fees shall specify the amount of reduction requested and the reasons which cause the requester to feel that the criteria for waiver or reduction of fees have been met.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> (i) Upon receipt of a fee waiver or fee reduction request the Director of Administrative Services will promptly determine whether such request should be granted in whole or in part. The request shall be reviewed in accordance with the following Statutory Freedom of Information Act fee waiver criteria:</P>
          <P>(A) Whether disclosure of the information “is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government”; and</P>
          <P>(B) That disclosure of the information “is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”</P>
          <P>(ii) There are six general factors which are considered in determining whether the statutory criteria for fee waiver have been met:</P>
          <P>(A) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government”;</P>
          <P>(B) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
          <P>(C) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding”; and</P>
          <P>(D) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
          <P>(E) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so</P>
          <P>(F) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”</P>
          <P>(iii) The decision to refuse to waive or reduce fees as requested under paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be appealed to the Director of the Peace Corps or such official as he or she may designate. Appeals should contain as much information and documentation as possible to support the request for a waiver or reduction of fees. The requester will be notified within ten working days from the date of which the Agency received the appeal.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Administrative Actions to Improve Assessment and Collection of Fees.</E> The Agency shall ensure that procedures for assessing and collecting fees are applied consistently and uniformly.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The Agency will begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The fact that the fee has been received by the Agency, even if not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31, United States Code, will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Charges for unsuccessful search.</E> The Agency will assess charges for time spent searching, even if the Agency fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Agency reasonably believes that a requester or, on rare occasions, a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Agency may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. The Agencies will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (i) Advance payment, i.e., payment before work is <PRTPAGE P="18"/>commenced or continued on a request are not required unless:</P>
          <P>(A) The Agency estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then, the Agency shall notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or</P>
          <P>(B) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e. within 30 days of the date of the billing), the Agency may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above, or to demonstrate that he has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.</P>
          <P>(ii) When the Agency acts under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial, plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after the Agency has received fee payments described above.</P>
          <P>(5) Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365). The Agency will follow those debt collection procedures published in 22 CFR part 309 where appropriate, to encourage repayment.</P>

          <P>This subpart states the requirements for eligibility for Peace Corps Volunteer service and the factors considered in the assessment and selection of eligible applicants for training and service. In selecting individuals for Peace Corps Volunteer service under this subpart, as required by section 5(a) of the Peace Corps Act, as amended, “no political test shall be required to be taken into consideration, nor shall there be any discrimination against any person on account of race, sex, creed, or color.” Further, in accordance with section 417(c)(1) of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5057 (c)(1)) the nondiscrimination policies and authorities set forth in section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16), title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791 et seq.) and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.), are also applicable to the selection, placement, service and termination of Peace Corps Volunteers.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Eligibility.</SUBJECT>
          <P>In addition to those skills, personal attributes and aptitudes required for available Volunteer assignments, the following are the basic requirements that an applicant must satisfy in order to receive an invitation to train for Peace Corps Volunteer service.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Citizenship.</E> The applicant must be a citizen of the United States or have made arrangements satisfactory to the Office of Marketing, Recruitment, Placement and Staging (MRPS) and the Office of General Counsel (D/GC) to be naturalized prior to taking the oath prescribed for enrollment as a Peace Corps Volunteer. (See section 5[a] of the Peace Corps Act, as amended).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Age.</E> The applicant must be at least 18 years old.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Medical status.</E> The applicant must, with reasonable accommodation, have the physical and mental capacity required of a Volunteer to perform the essential functions of the Peace Corps Volunteer assignment for which he or she is otherwise eligible, and be able to complete an agreed upon tour of service, ordinarily two years, without unreasonable disruption due to health problems. In determining what is a reasonable accommodation, the Peace Corps may take into account the adequacy of local medical facilities. In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the Peace Corps, factors to be considered include: (1) The overall size of the Peace Corps program with respect to the number of employees and/or Volunteers, size of budget, and size and composition of staff at post of assignment, (2) the nature and cost of the accommodation, and (3) the capacity of the host country agency to which the applicant would be assigned to provide any special accommodation necessary for the applicant to carry out the assignment.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Legal status.</E> The applicant must not be on parole or probation to any court or have any court established or acknowledged financial or other legal obligation which, in the opinion of D/GC and MRPS, cannot be satisfied or postponed during the period of Peace Corps service.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Intelligence background.</E> In accordance with longstanding Peace Corps policy, prior employment by any agency of the United States Government, civilian or military, or division of such an agency, whose exclusive or principle function is the performance of intelligence activities; or engaging in intelligence activities or related work may disqualify a person from eligibility for Peace Corps service. See section 611 of the Peace Corps Manual.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Marital status.</E> (1) Ordinarily, if an applicant is married or intends to marry prior to Peace Corps service, both husband and wife must apply and qualify for assignment at the same location. Exceptions to this rule will be considered by the Office of Volunteer Placement (MRPS/P) under the following conditions:</P>
          <P>(2)(i) <E T="03">Unaccompanied married applicant.</E> In order to qualify for consideration for Peace Corps service, a married applicant whose spouse does not wish to accompany him/her overseas must provide the Office of Placement (MRPS/P) with a notarized letter from <PRTPAGE P="23"/>the spouse acknowledging that he or she is aware of the applicant spouse's intention to serve as a Peace Corps Volunteer for two years or more and that any financial and legal obligations of the applicant to his or her spouse can be met during the period of Peace Corps service. In determining eligibility in such cases, MRPS/P will also consider whether the service of one spouse without the accompaniment of the other can reasonably be anticipated to disrupt the applicant spouse's service overseas.</P>
          <P>(ii) In addition to satisfying the above requirements, a married applicant who is legally, or in fact, separated from his or her spouse, must provide MRPS/P with copies of any agreements or other documentation setting forth any legal and financial responsibilities which the parties have to one another during any period of separation.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Divorced applicants.</E> Applicants who have been divorced must provide MRPS/P with copies of all legal documents related to the divorce.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Dependents.</E> Peace Corps has authority to provide benefits and allowances for the dependent children of Peace Corps Volunteers who are under the age of 18. However, applicants with dependent children under the age of 18 will not be considered eligible for Peace Corps service unless MRPS/P determines that the skills of the applicants are essential to meet the requirements of a Volunteer project, and that qualified applicants without minor dependents are not available to fill the assignment.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Procedures for placing volunteers with children.</E> The placement of any couple with dependent children must have the concurrence of the appropriate Country and Regional Director.</P>
          <P>(2) If the applicant has any dependents who will not accompany him or her overseas, the applicant must satisfy MRPS/P and the General Counsel that adequate arrangements have been made for the care and support of the dependent during any period of training and Peace Corps service; that such service will not adversely affect the relationship between the applicant and dependent in such a way as to disrupt his or her service; and that he or she is not using Peace Corps service to escape responsibility for the welfare of any dependents under the age of 18.</P>
          <P>(3) Married couples with more than two children or with children who are below two years of age are not eligible for Peace Corps service except in extraordinary circumstances as approved by the Director of the Peace Corps or designee.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Military service.</E> Applicants with military or national guard obligation must provide MRPS/P with a written statement from their commanding officer that their presence will not be required by their military unit for the duration of their Peace Corps service, except in case of national emergency.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Failure to disclose requested information.</E> Failure to disclose, and/or the misrepresentation of material information requested by the Peace Corps regarding any of the above described standards of eligibility may be grounds for disqualification or separation from Peace Corps Volunteer service. (See section 284 of the Peace Corps Manual.)</P>

          <SUBJECT>Background investigations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Section 22 of the Peace Corps Act states that to ensure enrollment of a Volunteer is consistent with the national interest, no applicant is eligible for Peace Corps Volunteer service without a background investigation. The Peace Corps requires that all applicants accepted for training have as a minimum a National Agency Check. Information revealed by the investigation may be grounds for disqualification from Peace Corps service.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Section 735.101 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires each agency head to issue his or her agency regulations regarding the ethical conduct and other responsibilities of all of its employees. All employees are responsible for complying with these regulations. One of the main purposes of the regulations in this part is to encourage individuals faced with <PRTPAGE P="25"/>questions involving subjective judgment to seek counsel and guidance. The Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) and Deputy and Alternate DAEO in the Office of General Counsel are designated to be the counselors for Peace Corps with respect to these matters. They will provide authoritative advice and guidance to any Peace Corps employee, former employee, or potential employee who seeks it.</P>
            <P>(b) The Peace Corps Committee on Conflict of Interest will review and monitor the Agency's policies and procedures on conflict of interest. The committee shall consist of the General Counsel, the Associate Director for Management, the Director for Compliance, the Director of Contracts, the Associate Director for International Operations, and the Director's designee, who shall be a nonvoting member. Committee membership is not delegable. The Designated and Deputy Agency Ethics Officials shall act as advisors to the Committee and shall record the Committee's decisions. The Committee, by majority vote, shall have the authority to:</P>
            <P>(1) Adopt the procedures necessary to insure the implementation of and compliance with the conflict of interest regulations found at §§ 307.735-301 through 307.735-305.</P>
            <P>(2) Issue interpretive opinions or clarifying statements on actual or hypothetical situations involving the provisions of §§ 307.735-301 through 307.735-305.</P>
            <P>(3) Accept and review reports filed under § 307.735-302(b).</P>
            <P>(4) Grant specific relief from the provisions of §§ 307.735-303 through 307.735-305 by a majority vote of the committee, if after due consideration the committee finds that:</P>
            <P>(i) No actual conflict of interest exists, and</P>
            <P>(ii) The purpose of the rule would not be served by its strict application, and</P>
            <P>(iii) A substantial inequity would otherwise occur. In each such case the committee shall issue a written decision setting forth its findings as required above. The committee may make any exception subject to such conditions and restrictions as it deems appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) Any violation of the regulations in this part may be cause for remedial or disciplinary action. Remedial action may include changes in assigned duties, disqualification for a particular assignment, divestment of a conflicting interest, and other action as appropriate. Violation of those provisions of the regulations in this part which reflect legal prohibitions may also entail penalties provided by law.</P>
            <P>(d) This part applies to all employees of Peace Corps. “Employee” as used in this part includes regular employees, Presidential appointees, “special Government employees,” experts and consultants whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or intermittent basis, and Foreign Service National employees (FSNs).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Special Government employee</E> as used herein means a person appointed or employed to perform temporary duties for Peace Corps with or without compensation, on a full-time, part-time, or intermittent basis, for not to exceed 130 days during any period of 365 days.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Regular Government employee</E> as used herein means any officer or employee other than a Special Government employee.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Organization</E> as used herein includes profit and non-profit corporations, associations, partnerships, trusts, sole proprietorships, foundations, individuals and foreign, State and local government units.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Potential Contractor</E> means any organization or individual that has submitted a proposal, application, or otherwise indicated in writing its intent to apply for or seek a specific contract or other agreement.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Associated with</E> means:</P>
            <P>(1) That the person is a director of the organization or is a member of a board or committee which exercises a recommending or supervisory function in connection with a Peace Corps project;</P>

            <P>(2) That the person serves as an employee, officer, owner, trustee, partner, consultant, or paid advisor (general membership in an organization is not included within the definition of “associated with”; however, because general <PRTPAGE P="26"/>membership in an organization doing business with the Peace Corps can result in problems of the appearance of conflicts of interest, each such general membership should be evaluated by the DAEO);</P>
            <P>(3) That the person, his or her spouse, minor child, or other member of his or her immediate household, owns, individually or collectively, any voting shares of an organization;</P>
            <P>(4) That the person, his or her spouse, minor child, or other member of his or her immediate household, owns, individually or collectively, either beneficially or as trustee, a financial interest in an organization through stock, stock options, bonds, or other securities, or obligations; or</P>
            <P>(5) That a person has a continuing financial interest in an organization, such as a bona fide pension plan, valued at $10,000 or more, through an arrangement resulting from prior employment or business or professional association; or</P>
            <P>(6) That the person's spouse or other member of his or her immediate household has a personal or nonpersonal services contract or is employed by a Peace Corps contractor and assigned to a Peace Corps contract.</P>

            <FP>In accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208(b) (1) and (2), the DAEO may determine that a financial interest under (e)(3) or (4) of this section is not so substantial as to affect the integrity of the employee's services, or make a blanket determination by a general rule published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that certain classes of holdings are too remote or inconsequential to affect the integrity of the employee's services.</FP>
            <P>The term <E T="03">associated with</E> does not include an indirect interest, such as ownership of shares in a diversified mutual fund, bank or insurance company, which in turn owns an interest in an organization which has, or is seeking or is under consideration for a contract or other agreement. Such an “indirect” interest is hereby determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2) to be too remote to affect the integrity of the employee's services.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Regular Government employees</E>. Regular employees of the Government are subject to the following major criminal prohibitions:</P>

            <P>(1) They may not, except in the discharge of their official duties, represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest. This prohibition applies to both paid and unpaid representation of another (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205).<PRTPAGE P="27"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) They may not participate in their governmental capacity in any matter in which they, their spouse, minor child, outside business associate, or persons with whom they are negotiating for employment have a financial interest (18 U.S.C. 208). This restriction shall not apply if an employee advises the official responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and circumstances of the matter, fully discloses the financial interest, and receives in advance from the appointing official a written determination that the interest is not so substantial as to affect the integrity of the Peace Corps.</P>
            <P>(3) They may not, after Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a particular matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and in which they participated personally and substantially for the Government (18 U.S.C. 207).</P>
            <P>(4) They may not for 2 years after their Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and which was within the boundaries of their official responsibility during their last year of Government service. This temporary restraint gives way to the permanent restraint described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section if the matter is one in which the employee participated personally and substantially (18 U.S.C. 207).</P>
            <P>(5) They may not receive any salary, or supplementation of their Government salary, from a private source as compensation for services to the Government (18 U.S.C. 209).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Special Government employees</E>. Special Government employees are subject to the following major criminal prohibitions:</P>
            <P>(1) They may not, except in the discharge of official duties, represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and in which they have at any time participated personally and substantially for the Government (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205).</P>
            <P>(2) They may not, except in the discharge of official duties, represent anyone else in a matter pending before the agency they serve unless they have served there no more than 60 days during the past 365. They are bound by this restraint despite the fact that the matter is not one in which they have ever participated personally and substantially (18 U.S.C. 205). (See § 307.735-303(b) for additional nonstatutory Agency restrictions on a special employee representing any other person or organization in a matter pending before the Agency.) The restrictions described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section apply to both paid and unpaid representation of another.</P>
            <P>(3) They may not participate in their governmental capacity in any matter in which they, their spouse, minor child, outside business associate, or persons with whom they are negotiating for employment have a financial interest (18 U.S.C. 208).</P>
            <P>(4) They may not, after their Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a particular matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and in which they participated personally and substantially for the Government (18 U.S.C. 207).</P>
            <P>(5) They may not, for 2 years after their Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and which was within the boundaries of their official responsibility during their last year of Government service. This temporary restraint gives way to the permanent restriction described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section if the matter is one in which they participated personally and substantially (18 U.S.C. 207).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Senior Employees</E>. Employees in positions for which the basic rate of pay is specified in subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code (Executive Schedule Pay Rates), or a comparable or greater rate of pay under other authority; and employees in positions which involve significant decision-making or supervisory responsibility for which the basic rate of pay is equal to or greater than the basic rate of pay for GS-17 (FE-2), are Senior Employees.<PRTPAGE P="28"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Senior Employees are subject to the criminal conflict-of-interest statutes at 18 U.S.C. 203, 205, 207 (a), (b), and (c), 208 and 209. Within 2 years after his or her employment has ceased, no Senior Employee may knowingly represent or aid, counsel, advise, consult, or assist in representing any other person (except the United States) by personal presence at any formal or informal appearance before:</P>
            <P>(i) Any department, agency, or court, or any officer or employee thereof,</P>

            <P>(a) There is no general prohibition against Peace Corps employees holding outside employment, including teaching, lecturing, or writing, but no employee may engage in outside employment or associations if they might result in a conflict or an appearance of conflict between the private interests of the employee and his or her official responsibility. As provided in 5 CFR 735.203(a), incompatible activities include, but are not limited to, acceptance of a fee or anything of monetary value when acceptance may result in an actual or apparent conflict of interest, and outside employment which tends to impair the employee's mental or physical capacity to perform Government duties and responsibilities in an acceptable manner. Any employee planning to engage in outside employment shall so notify his or her supervisor and the DAEO of the name of the proposed employer and the nature of the proposed duties. The DAEO will acknowledge receipt of this information to the employee and supervisor. If the DAEO believes that the information raises a question of conflict of interest, the DAEO shall submit the information for review and resolution to the Committee on Conflict of Interest in accordance with § 307.735-101.</P>
            <P>(b) An employee shall not receive any salary or anything of monetary value from a private source as compensation for his or her services to the Government (18 U.S.C. 209).</P>

            <P>(c) An employee shall not have a direct or indirect financial interest that conflicts substantially or appears to conflict substantially with his or her Government duties and responsibilities. Nor may an employee engage in, directly or indirectly, a financial transaction as a result of or primarily relying on information obtained through his or her Government employment.<PRTPAGE P="29"/>

The third party shall participate in and review the decision process to the extent he or she deems necessary to insure objectivity and the absence of favoritism. Said third party shall preferably be a person experienced in the area of government contracts. The third party shall file a report in writing with the Committee on Conflict of Interest stating his or her conclusions, observations, or objections, if any, to the decision process concerning the contract or agreement, which document shall be attached to and become a part of the official file.</P>

            <P>(b) No regular or special employee, except in his or her official capacity as a Peace Corps employee, shall either participate in any way on behalf of any organization in the preparation or development of a contract proposal involving Peace Corps or represent any other organization in a matter pending before Peace Corps. In the event that a regular or special employee participates while an employee of Peace Corps in any aspect of the development of a contract or agreement proposal on behalf of an organization, or represents another organization in a matter pending before Peace Corps, that organization shall be suspended from consideration for the contract or other agreement. If the employee's prohibited participation is discovered after award of the contract, appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken, including, but not limited to, the placement of a letter describing the violation in the employee's official personnel file.</P>
            <P>(c) No regular or special employee who, prior to his or her employment at Peace Corps, participated in the development of a contract or other agreement proposal on behalf of another organization, shall participate as a Peace Corps employee in any aspect of the decision process regarding that contract or other agreement, or, if the contract or other agreement is awarded, in any oversight or management capacity in relation to that contract or other agreement. In addition, any such contract or other agreement shall only be awarded through a competitive process. In the event a regular or special employee who participated in the development of the contract or other agreement proposal prior to being employed at Peace Corps does participate as a Peace Corps employee in the decision process for such contract or other agreement, the organization shall be suspended from consideration.</P>
            <P>(d) If a special employee participates as an employee of Peace Corps in any aspect of the development of a proposal, whether or not such participation is minimal or substantial, any organization with which he or she is associated shall be suspended from consideration for the contract or other agreement.</P>

            <P>(e) If an organization with which a special employee is associated submits a proposal for a contract or other agreement, and the special employee <PRTPAGE P="30"/>did not participate either as an employee of Peace Corps or an associate of the organization in any aspect of the proposal or the application therefor, the matter shall be referred to the Committee on Conflict of Interest for determination. The Committee shall consider the following factors and any others it deems relevant:</P>
            <P>(1) The nature, length, and origin of the special employee's relationship with the Agency, the nature and scope of the employee's duties and responsibilities, the division or office to which the employee is assigned, and whether the employee's duties are in any way related to the proposed contract or other agreement.</P>
            <P>(2) The nature, length, and type of the employee's relationship with the organization, whether the employee's position involves policy making or supervision of other employees and the relationship of the position with the organization to the work to be performed under the proposed contract or other agreement.</P>

This 1-year ban shall not apply to those overseas employees whose positions are converted to personal services contracts at the convenience of the Peace Corps as determined jointly by the Associate Directors for International Operations and Management.</P>

            <P>(c) If, within 1 year after leaving Peace Corps, an individual accepts employment in violation of this rule, Peace Corps will disallow the costs allocated under the contract or other agreement for that position.

            <P>(i) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with Peace Corps;</P>
            <P>(ii) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official responsibility;</P>
            <P>(iii) It is any way attempting to affect the employee's exercise of his or her official responsibility; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by Peace Corps.</P>
            <P>(2) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not prohibit, even if the donor has dealings with Peace Corps:</P>
            <P>(i) Acceptance of things of value from parents, children, or spouse if those relationships rather than the business of the donor is the motivating factor for the gift;</P>
            <P>(ii) Acceptance of food and refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of breakfast, luncheon, or dinner meetings or other meetings;</P>
            <P>(iii) Solicitation and acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans, solicited and accepted on customary terms;</P>

            <P>(iv) Acceptance on behalf of minor dependents of fellowships, scholarships, <PRTPAGE P="32"/>or educational loans awarded on the basis of merit and/or need;</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">From other Peace Corps employees.</E> No employees in superior official positions may accept any gifts presented as contributions from employees in lower grades. No employees shall solicit contributions from other employees for a gift to an employee in a superior official position, nor shall any employees make a donation as a gift to an employee in a superior official position. However, this paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, or retirement.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">From foreign governments.</E> No regular employee may solicit or, without the consent of the Congress, receive any present, decoration, emolument, pecuniary favor, office, title, or any other gift from any foreign government.

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Reimbursement for expenses.</E> Neither this section nor § 307.735-310(a) precludes an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this part and for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. An employee may personally accept reimbursement from organizations that qualify for tax-deductible contributions under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on his or her behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits. Nor does it allow an employee to receive non-Government reimbursement of travel expenses for travel on official business under Peace Corps orders; but rather, such reimbursement, if any, should be made to Peace Corps and amounts received should be credited to its appropriation. If an employee receives accommodations, goods, or services in kind from a non-Government source, this item or items will be treated as a donation to Peace Corps and an appropriate reduction will be made in per diem or other travel expenses payable.</P>

            <P>A regular or special employee shall not directly or indirectly use, or allow the use of, Government property of any kind, including property leased to the Government for other than officially approved activities. All employees have a positive duty to protect and conserve Government property, including equipment, supplies, and other property entrusted or issued to them.

            <P>Peace Corps considers the indebtedness of its employees to be a matter of their own concern and will not function as a collection agency. Nevertheless, a regular or special employee shall pay each just financial obligation in a proper and timely manner, especially one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local taxes. For the purpose of this section, a “just financial obligation” means one acknowledged by the employee or reduced to judgment by a court, or one imposed by law such as Federal, State or local taxes, and “in a proper and timely manner” means in a manner which the agency determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Government as his or her employer. In the event of a dispute between an employee and an alleged creditor, this section does not require Peace Corps to determine the validity or amount of the disputed debt.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 307.735-401</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Submission of statements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Officials and employees occupying positions classified at the FE-3 level and above are required by title II of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, title II of Pub. L. 95-521, to file annual Executive Personnel Financial Disclosure Reports. They need not also file the statement of employment and financial interests required by the following provisions.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Regulations of the Office of Personnel Policy and Operations (5 CFR part 735) require Peace Corps to adopt regulations providing for the submission of statements of employment and financial interests from certain regular employees and all special employees.</P>
            <P>(2) All special employees and those regular employees occupying positions described in paragraph (c) of this section shall complete statements of employment and financial interests and submit them to the DAEO not later than 5 days prior to entrance on duty. The Director of Personnel Policy and Operations shall be responsible for supplying all new employees with the necessary forms prior to their initial employment, extensions, or reappointments.</P>
            <P>(3) The initial statement of employment and financial interests shall include information on organizations with which the employee was associated during the 2 years prior to his or her employment by Peace Corps, as well as information about current associations. Special employees shall also indicate to the best of their knowledge which organizations listed currently on their forms have contracts with or are applying for contracts with the Peace Corps. If any information required to be included on the statement, including holdings placed in trust, is not known to an employee but is known to another person, he or she is required to request that other person to submit information on his or her behalf.</P>
            <P>(4) Current employees shall file a statement on or before June 30 each year. The Director of Personnel Policy and Operations shall be responsible for insuring that statements are distributed to all affected employees. Notwithstanding the filing of the annual report required by this paragraph each employee shall at all times avoid acquiring a financial interest that could result, or taking an action that would result, in a conflict of interest and a violation of the conflict-of-interest provisions of section 208 of title 18, United States Code, or the conflict-of-interest provisions of this part.</P>

            <P>(5) In the case of temporary summer employees hired at FP-7 or equivalent and below to perform duties other than those of an expert or consultant, the reporting requirement will be waived. It may also be waived by the Director of Personnel Policy and Operations <PRTPAGE P="37"/>with respect to other appointments, except as experts or consultants, upon a finding that the duties of the position held by the special Government employee are of a nature and at such a level of responsibility that the reporting of employment and financial interests is not necessary to protect the integrity of the Government.</P>
            <P>(6) Regular or special employees are not required to submit in a statement of employment and financial interests any information about their connection with or interest in a professional society or a charitable, religious, social, fraternal, recreational, public service, civic, or political organization not conducted as a business enterprise. For this purpose, any organizations doing work involving or potentially involving contracts with the Government are considered business enterprises and are required to be included in a regular or special employee's statement of employment and financial interests.</P>
            <P>(7) The statements of employment and financial interests required are in addition, and not in substitution for or in derogation of, any similar requirement imposed by law, order, or regulation. The submission of a statement by an employee does not permit him or her or any other person to participate in a matter in which his or her or other persons’ participation is prohibited by law, order, or regulations.</P>
            <P>(8) A regular employee who believes that his or her position has been improperly included under Peace Corps regulations as one requiring the submission of a statement of employment and financial interests shall be given an opportunity for review through Peace Corps’ grievance procedures to determine whether the position has been improperly included.</P>
            <P>(c) Statements shall be submitted by employees who are engaged in any aspect of Government contracting or procurement activities including, but not limited to, the planning, design, award, monitoring, and evaluation of Peace Corps procurement of goods and services; and by all special employees (expert and consultants).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 307.735-402</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Review of statements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The DAEO shall review all statements and forward the names of all listed organizations to the Director of Contracts. In addition, if the information provided in the statement indicates on its face a real, apparent, or potential conflict of interest under §§ 307.735-301 through 307.735-305 of these standards, the DAEO will review the situation with the particular employee. If the DAEO and the employee are unable to resolve the conflict to the DAEO's satisfaction, or if the employee wishes to request an exception to any of the above enumerated rules, the case will be referred to the Committee on Conflict of Interest. The Committee is authorized to recommend appropriate remedial action to the Director, who is authorized to take such action as may include, but is not limited to, changing assigned duties, requiring the employee or special employee to divest himself of a conflicting interest, taking disciplinary action, or disqualifying or accepting the self-disqualification of the employee or special employee for a particular assignment.</P>
            <P>(b) The Contracts Division shall maintain a list of all the organizations with which employees are or have been associated, as well as a list of all current contractors with the Agency. The list of organizations shall include the names of all employees associated with the identified organizations. When names of organizations with which new employees are or have been associated are submitted to the Contracts Office, they shall be checked against the list of current contractors. Similarly, before any new contracts are awarded, the names of the potential contractors will be checked against the master list of organizations with which employees are or have been associated. Any real, apparent, or potential conflicts which come to light as a result of these cross checks will be referred to the DAEO for review. The DAEO will proceed as in paragraph (a) of this section, referring the matter to the Committee on Conflict of Interest if necessary.</P>

            <P>(c) Whenever an organization submits a proposal or application or otherwise indicates in writing its intent to apply for or seek a specific contract, the Peace Corps Contracts Division shall <PRTPAGE P="38"/>immediately forward a copy of the relevant sections of the Agency standards of conduct to that organization.</P>
            <P>(d) Whenever a regular or special employee begins or terminates his or her employment with Peace Corps, the Office of Personnel Policy and Operations shall provide that employee with a copy of the rules found in § 307.735-304 restricting a person's employment after leaving Peace Corps. Personnel shall also notify the DAEO when an employee terminates. One year after the date of termination the DAEO will instruct the Contracts Office to remove from the master list any organizations with which the terminated employee was associated unless other current employees are associated with those organizations. Six years after the date of termination the DAEO will destroy the statement of employment and financial interests.</P>

          <P>The head of the agency has the responsibility of maintaining adequate technical, physical, and security safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure or destruction of manual and automatic record systems. These security safeguards shall apply to all systems in which identifiable personal data are processed or maintained including all reports and outputs from such systems which contain identifiable personal information. Such safeguards must be sufficient to prevent negligent, accidental, or unintentional disclosure, modification or destruction of any personal records or data and must furthermore minimize the extent technicians or knowledgeable persons could improperly obtain access to modify or destroy such records or data and shall further insure against such casual entry by unskilled persons without official reasons for access to such records or data.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Manual systems.</E> (1) Records contained in records systems as defined herein may be used, held or stored only where facilities are adequate to prevent unauthorized access by persons within or without the agency.</P>

Where appropriate, such cabinet shall have a three position dial-type combination lock, and/or be equipped with a steel lock bar secured by a GSA approved changeable combination padlock or in some such other securely locked cabinet as may be approved by GSA for the storage of such records. Certain systems are not of such confidential nature that their disclosure would harm an individual who <PRTPAGE P="41"/>is the subject of such record. Records in this category shall be maintained in steel cabinets without the necessity of combination locks.</P>
          <P>(3) Access to and use of systems of records shall be permitted only to persons whose official duties require such access within the agency, for routine use as defined in § 308.4 and in the Peace Corps’ published systems of records notices, or for such other uses as may be provided herein.</P>
          <P>(4) Other than for access within the agency to persons needing such records in the performance of their official duties or routine uses as defined herein and in the Peace Corps’ systems of records notices or such other uses as provided herein, access to records within systems of records shall be permitted only to the individual to whom the record pertains or upon his or her written request to a designated personal representative.</P>
          <P>(5) Access to areas where records systems are stored will be limited to those persons whose official duties require work in such areas and proper accounting of removal of any records from storage areas shall be maintained at all times in the form directed by the Director, Administrative Services.</P>
          <P>(6) The agency shall assure that all persons whose official duties require access to and use of records contained in records systems are adequately trained to protect the security and privacy of such records.</P>
          <P>(7) The disposal and destruction of records within records systems shall be in accord with rules promulgated by the General Services Administration.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Automated systems.</E> (1) Identifiable personal information may be processed, stored or maintained by automatic data systems only where facilities or conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized access to such systems in any form. Whenever such data contained in punch cards, magnetic tapes or discs are not under the personal control of an authorized person such information must be stored in a metal filing cabinet having a built-in three position combination lock, a metal filing cabinet equipped with a steel lock, a metal filing cabinet equipped with a steel lock bar secured with a General Services Administration (GSA) approved combination padlock, or in adequate containers or in a secured room or in such other facility having greater safeguards than those provided for herein.</P>
          <P>(2) Access to and use of identifiable personal data associated with automated data systems shall be limited to those persons whose official duties require such access. Proper control of personal data in any form associated with automated data systems shall be maintained at all times including maintenance of accountability records showing disposition of input and output documents.</P>
          <P>(3) All persons whose official duties require access to processing and maintenance of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be adequately trained in the security and privacy of personal data.</P>
          <P>(4) The disposal and disposition of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be carried on by shredding, burning or in the case of tapes of discs, degaussing, in accord with any regulations now or hereafter proposed by the GSA or other appropriate authority.</P>

The agency shall have the authority to limit the length of any statement to be filed, such limit to depend upon the record involved. The agency shall also inform such individual that prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of both statements of the dispute to the extent that the accounting of disclosures has been maintained and of the individual's right to seek judicial review of the agency's refusal to amend the record.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The purpose of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), is to provide a comprehensive statutory approach to the collection of debts due the United States Government. This subpart implements section 5 thereof which authorizes the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of <PRTPAGE P="50"/>salary offsets. No claim may be collected by salary offset if the debt has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection of such debts.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 309.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart provides Peace Corps’ procedures for the collection by salary offset of a Federal employee's pay to satisfy certain past due debts owed the United States Government.</P>
            <P>(b) This subpart applies to collections by the Peace Corps from:</P>
            <P>(1) Federal employees who owe debts to the Peace Corps; and</P>
            <P>(2) Employees of the Peace Corps who owe debts to other agencies.</P>

            <P>(c) This subpart does not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).</P>
            <P>(d) This subpart does not apply to any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.</P>

            <P>(e) Nothing in this subpart precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions where appropriate under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711 <E T="03">et seq.;</E> 4 CFR parts 101 through 105).</P>

            <P>The provisions of this subpart are to be followed in instances where:</P>
            <P>(a) The Peace Corps is owed a debt by an individual currently employed by another agency;</P>
            <P>(b) The Peace Corps is owed a debt by an individual who is a current employee of the Peace Corps; or</P>
            <P>(c) The Peace Corps currently employs an individual who owes a debt to another Federal agency. Upon receipt of proper certification from the creditor agency, the Peace Corps will offset the debtor-employee's salary in accordance with these regulations.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 309.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Waiver requests and claims to the General Accounting Office.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The provisions of this subpart do not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the General Accounting Office. This subpart also does not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver pursuant to other statutory provisions pertaining to the particular debts being collected.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notice requirements before offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Deductions under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be made unless the creditor agency first provides the employee with written notice that he/she owes a debt to the Federal Government at least 30 calendar days before salary offset is to be initiated. When Peace Corps is the creditor agency this notice of intent to offset an employee's salary shall be hand-delivered or sent by certified mail to the most current address that is available. The written notice will state:</P>
            <P>(1) That Peace Corps has reviewed the records relating to the claim and has determined that a debt is owed, its origin and nature, and the amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) The intention of Peace Corps to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account until the debt and all accumulated interest is paid in full;</P>

            <P>(3) The amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions; <PRTPAGE P="51"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) An explanation of the Peace Corps’ policy concerning interest, penalties and administrative costs, including a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with § 309.4(d);</P>
            <P>(5) The employee's right to inspect and copy all records of the Peace Corps pertaining to the debt claimed or to receive copies of such records if personal inspection is impractical;</P>
            <P>(6) The right to a hearing conducted by a hearing official (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, a hearing official not under the supervision or control of the Peace Corps) with respect to the existence and amount of the debt claimed, or the repayment schedule (i.e., the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period), so long as a petition is filed by the employee as prescribed in § 309.11;</P>
            <P>(7) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Peace Corps) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the creditor agency (4 CFR 102.2(e));</P>
            <P>(8) The name, address and telephone number of an officer or employee of the Peace Corps who may be contacted concerning procedures for requesting a hearing;</P>
            <P>(9) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;</P>
            <P>(10) That the timely filing of a petition for hearing within 15 calendar days after delivery of the notice of intent to offset will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;</P>
            <P>(11) The name and address of the office to which the petition should be sent;</P>
            <P>(12) That the Peace Corps will initiate certification procedures to implement a salary offset, as appropriate, (which may not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay) not less than 30 calendar days from the date of delivery of the notice of debt, unless the employee files a timely petition for a hearing;</P>
            <P>(13) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 calendar days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;</P>
            <P>(14) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations or evidence may subject the employee to:</P>
            <P>(i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under chapter 75 of 5 U.S.C., 5 CFR 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, §§ 3729-3731 of title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 or any other applicable authority;</P>

            <P>(b) The Peace Corps is not required to comply with paragraph (a) of this section for any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for review.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee who desires a review concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the proposed offset schedule must send a request to the office designated in the notice of intent. See § 309.10(a)(8). The request for review must be received by the designated office not later than 15 calendar days after the date of delivery of the notice as provided in § 309.10(a). The request must be signed by the employee and <PRTPAGE P="52"/>should identify and explain with reasonable specificity and brevity the facts, evidence and witnesses which the employee believes support his or her position. If the employee objects to the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted from each check, the request should state the objection and the reasons for it. The employee must also specify whether an oral hearing or a review of the documentary evidence is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Failure to timely submit.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) If the employee files a petition for a review after the expiration of the 15 calendar day period provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the designated office may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control, or because of a failure to receive the notice of the filing deadline (unless the employee has actual knowledge of the filing deadline).</P>
            <P>(2) An employee waives the right to a review, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with Peace Corps’ offset schedule, if the employee fails to file a request for a hearing unless such failure is excused as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) If the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was notified, unless the hearing official determines failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control, his or her appeal will be decided on the basis of the documents then available to the hearing official.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Representation at the hearing</E>. The creditor agency may be represented by a representative of its choice. The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of his or her choice and at his or her expense.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of Peace Corps records related to the debt</E>.</P>
            <P>(1) An employee who intends to inspect or copy creditor agency records related to the debt in accordance with § 309.10(a)(5), must send a letter to the official designated in the notice of intent to offset stating his or her intention. The letter must be sent within 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice.</P>
            <P>(2) In response to a timely request submitted by the debtor, the designated official will notify the employee of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records related to the debt.</P>
            <P>(3) If personal inspection is impractical, copies of such records shall be sent to the employee.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Hearing official</E>. Unless the Peace Corps appoints an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing, the Peace Corps must obtain a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Peace Corps.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Obtaining the services of a hearing official when the Peace Corps is the creditor agency</E>.</P>
            <P>(1) When the debtor is not a Peace Corps employee, and in the event that the Peace Corps cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before an administrative law judge or before a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful arrangement, the Peace Corps may contact an agent of the paying agency designated in appendix A to part 581 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations or as otherwise designated by the agency, and request a hearing official.</P>
            <P>(2) When the debtor is a Peace Corps employee, the Peace Corps may contact any agent of another agency designated in appendix A to part 581 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations or otherwise designated by that agency, to request a hearing official.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Procedure</E>. (1) If the employee requests a review, the hearing official or administrative law judge shall notify the employee of the form of the review to be provided. If an oral hearing is authorized, the notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the review will be on documentary evidence, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official or administrative law judge by a specified date, after which the record will be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time (not less than 14 calendar days) to submit documentation. <PRTPAGE P="53"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Oral hearing</E>. An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official or administrative law judge determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g. when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication, and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing. Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Informal conferences with the hearing official or administrative law judge, in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses and argument;</P>
            <P>(ii) Informal meetings with an interview of the employee; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral presentation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Paper review</E>. If the hearing official or administrative law judge determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Record</E>. The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this subpart. See 4 CFR 102.3. Witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Date of decision</E>. The hearing official or administrative law judge shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 calendar days after the date on which the petition was received by the creditor agency, unless the employee requests a delay in the proceedings. In such case the 60 day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Content of decision</E>. The written decision shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) The hearing official's findings, analysis and conclusions; and</P>
            <P>(3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Failure to appear</E>. In the absence of good cause shown (e.g., excused illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. If the representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date upon the request of the agency representative upon showing of good cause. Both parties shall be given the time and place of the new hearing.</P>

            <P>(a) In response to a notice of intent, an employee may propose a written <PRTPAGE P="54"/>agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt and set forth a proposed repayment schedule. Any proposal under this paragraph must be received by the official designated in that notice within 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice of intent.</P>
            <P>(b) When the Peace Corps is the creditor agency, in response to a timely proposal by the debtor the agency will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the agency's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Peace Corps decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 calendar days from the date he or she received notice of the decision to file a petition for a review.</P>
            <P>(d) If the Peace Corps decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and a designated agency official.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement, may at any time request a special review by the creditor agency of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.</P>
            <P>(b) In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs for food, housing, clothing, transportation and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse and dependents indicating:</P>
            <P>(1) Income from all sources;</P>
            <P>(2) Assets;</P>
            <P>(3) Liabilities;</P>

            <P>(7) Exceptional expenses, if any.</P>
            <P>(c) If the employee requests a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the current salary offset or payments result in significant financial hardship to the employee.</P>
            <P>(d) The Peace Corps shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes significant financial hardship on the employee. The Peace Corps shall notify the employee in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule.</P>
            <P>(e) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Peace Corps salary offset coordination officer shall provide a new certification to the paying agency.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notice of salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Upon receipt of proper certification of the creditor agency, the Peace Corps payroll office will send the employee a written notice of salary offset. Such notice shall, at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(1) Contain a copy of the certification received from the creditor agency; and</P>
            <P>(2) Advise the employee that salary offset will be initiated at the next officially established pay interval.</P>
            <P>(b) The payroll office shall provide a copy of the notice to the creditor agency and advise such agency of the dollar amount to be offset and the pay period when the offset will begin.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Director (or designee) shall coordinate salary deductions under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) The payroll office shall determine the amount of the employee's disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.</P>
            <P>(c) Deductions shall begin within 3 official pay periods following receipt by the payroll office of certification.</P>
            <P>(d) Types of collection. (1) <E T="03">Lump-sum payment.</E> If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, such debt generally will be collected in one lump-sum payment. <PRTPAGE P="55"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Installment deductions.</E> Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any period may not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Lump-sum deductions from final check.</E> A lump-sum deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Lump-sum deductions from other sources.</E> Whenever an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Peace Corps, and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, the Peace Corps, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, may offset any later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Multiple debts.</E> In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Precedence of debts owed to the Peace Corps.</E> For Peace Corps employees, debts owed to the agency generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. In the event that a debt to the Peace Corps is certified while an employee is subject to a salary offset to repay another agency, the payroll office may decide whether to have that debt repaid in full before collecting its claim or whether changes should be made in the salary deduction being sent to the other agency. If debts owed the Peace Corps can be collected in one pay period, the payroll office may suspend the salary offset to the other agency for that pay period in order to liquidate the Peace Corps’ debt. When an employee owes two or more debts, the best interests of the Government shall be the primary consideration in the determination by the payroll office of the order of the debt collection.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(1) The Director or Director's designee shall coordinate debt collections and shall, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(i) Arrange for a hearing upon proper petition by a federal employee; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Prescribe such practices and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the intent of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(2) Designate a salary offset coordination officer who will be responsible for:</P>
            <P>(i) Ensuring that each notice of intent to offset is consistent with the requirements of § 309.10;</P>
            <P>(ii) Ensuring that each certification of debt sent to a paying agency is consistent with the requirements of § 309.12;</P>
            <P>(iii) Obtaining hearing officials from other agencies pursuant to § 309.11(f); and</P>
            <P>(iv) Ensuring that hearings are properly scheduled.</P>
            <P>(3) Request recovery from current paying agency. Upon completion of the procedures established in these regulations and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Peace Corps must:</P>
            <P>(i) Certify, in writing, that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payments are due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the Peace Corps’ regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;</P>
            <P>(ii) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a) and give the dates the actions were taken (unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency);</P>

            <P>(iii) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, submit a debt claim containing the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) <PRTPAGE P="56"/>and (ii) of this section and an installment agreement (or other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable, to the employee's paying agency;</P>
            <P>(iv) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Peace Corps must submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in § 309.16. The paying agency must certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor agency and the employee as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, the Peace Corps must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.</P>

            <P>(v) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Peace Corps may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt (See 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 41 CFR 102.4).</P>
            <P>(4) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the Peace Corps need not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to continue the collection. The Peace Corps must review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is continued by the new paying agency.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Complete claim.</E> When the Peace Corps receives a certified claim from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval. The employee must receive written notice that the Peace Corps has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency (including the amount) and written notice of the date salary offset will begin and the amount of such deductions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Incomplete claim.</E> When the Peace Corps receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Peace Corps must return the debt claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart must be followed and a properly certified debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> The Peace Corps is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another.</E> If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the Peace Corps, the employee transfers to another agency before the debt is collected in full, the Peace Corps must certify the total amount collected on the debt. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the employee and one copy to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer.</P>

            <P>The provisions of this subpart apply to the collection of debts owed to the United States arising from transactions with the Peace Corps. Administrative offset is authorized under section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3716). These regulations are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on administrative offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office as set forth in 4 CFR part 102.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Director of the Peace Corps (or designee) will determine the feasibility of collection by administrative offset on a case-by-case basis for each claim established. The Director (or designee) will consider the following issues in making a determination to collect a claim by administrative offset:</P>
            <P>(1) Can administrative offset be accomplished?</P>
            <P>(2) Is administrative offset practical and legal?</P>
            <P>(3) Does administrative offset best serve and protect the interest of the U.S. Government?</P>
            <P>(4) Is administrative offset appropriate given the debtor's financial condition?</P>
            <P>(b) The Director (or designee) may initiate administrative offset with regard to debts owed by a person to another agency of the United States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another agency or his or her designee, and a certification that the debt exists and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.</P>
            <P>(c) The Director (or designee) may request another agency that holds funds payable to a Peace Corps debtor to offset the debt against the funds held and will provide certification that:</P>
            <P>(1) The debt exists; and <PRTPAGE P="60"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.</P>
            <P>(d) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering the debt.</P>
            <P>(e) Administrative offset under this subpart may not be initiated against:</P>
            <P>(1) A debt in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute;</P>
            <P>(2) Debts owed by other agencies of the United States or by any State or local Government; or</P>
            <P>(3) Debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; the Social Security Act; or the tariff laws of the United States.</P>
            <P>(f) The procedures for administrative offset in this subpart do not apply to the offset of Federal salaries under 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Demand for payment—notice.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Whenever possible, the Peace Corps will seek written consent from the debtor to initiate immediate collection before starting the formal notification process.</P>
            <P>(b) In cases where written agreement to collect cannot be obtained from the debtor, a formal notification process shall be followed, 4 CFR 102.2. Prior to collecting a claim by administrative offset, the Peace Corps shall send to the debtor, by certified or registered mail with return receipt, written demands for payment in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. A total of 3 progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30 day intervals will normally be made unless a response to the first or second demand indicates that a further demand would be futile or the debtor's response does not require rebuttal, or other pertinent information indicates that additional written demands would be unnecessary. In determining the timing of the demand letters, the Peace Corps should give due regard to the need to act promptly so that, as a general rule, if necessary to refer the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation, such referral can be made within 1 year of the final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt. When appropriate to protect the Government's interests (for example, to prevent the statute of limitations from expiring), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions, including immediate referral for litigation.</P>
            <P>(c) Before offset is made, a written notice will be sent to the debtor. This notice will include:</P>
            <P>(1) The nature and amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) The date when payment is due (not less than 30 days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the notice);</P>
            <P>(3) The agency's intention to collect the debt by administrative offset, including asking the assistance of other Federal agencies to help in the offset whenever possible, if the debtor has not made payment by the payment due date or has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due date;</P>
            <P>(4) Any provision for interest, late payment penalties and administrative charges, if payment is not received by the due date;</P>
            <P>(5) The possible reporting of the claim to consumer reporting agencies and the possibility that Peace Corps will forward the claim to a collection agency;</P>
            <P>(6) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy Peace Corps’ records related to the claim;</P>
            <P>(7) The right of the debtor to request a review of the determination of indebtedness and, in the circumstances described below, to request an oral hearing from the Peace Corps;</P>
            <P>(8) The right of the debtor to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the debt in some other way; and</P>
            <P>(9) In appropriate cases, the right of the debtor to request a waiver.</P>

            <P>(d) Claims for payment of travel advances and employee training expenses require notification prior to administrative offset as described in this section. Because no oral hearing is required, notice of the right to a hearing need not be included in the notification. <PRTPAGE P="61"/>

            <P>(a) Has not made payment by the payment due date;</P>
            <P>(b) Has not requested a review of the claim within the agency as set out in § 309.34; or</P>

            <P>(a) A debtor may dispute the existence of the debt, the amount of the debt, or the terms of repayment. A request to review a disputed debt must be submitted to the Peace Corps official who provided notification within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written notice described in § 309.32(c).</P>
            <P>(b) The Peace Corps will provide a copy of the record to the debtor and advise him/her to furnish available evidence to support his or her position. Upon receipt of the evidence, the Peace Corps will review the written record of indebtedness and inform the debtor of its findings.</P>
            <P>(c) Pending the resolution of a dispute by the debtor, transactions in any of the debtor's accounts maintained by the Peace Corps may be temporarily suspended. Depending on the type of transaction the suspension could preclude its payment, removal, or transfer, as well as prevent the payment of interest or discount due thereon. Should the dispute be resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be immediately lifted.</P>
            <P>(d) During the review period, interest, penalties, and administrative costs authorized under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, will continue to accrue.</P>

            <P>(ii) The debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The waiver determination rests on an issue of creditability or veracity; or</P>
            <P>(2) The debtor requests reconsideration and the Peace Corps determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by reviewing the documentary evidence.</P>

            <P>If the debtor requests a repayment agreement in place of offset, the Peace Corps has discretion and should use sound judgment to determine whether to accept a repayment agreement in place of offset. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, the Peace Corps will not accept a repayment agreement in place of offset unless the debtor is able to establish that offset would cause undue financial hardship or be unjust. No repayment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a financial statement, executed under penalty of perjury, reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement must be submitted within 10 business days of the Peace Corps’ request for the statement. At the Peace Corps’ option, a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety may be required for installment agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by 4 CFR part 103 and 31 CFR 5.3.</P>

            <P>(a) If the debtor does not exercise the right to request a review within the time specified in § 309.34, or if as a result of the review, it is determined that the debt is due and no written agreement is executed, then administrative offset shall be ordered in accordance with this subpart without further notice. <PRTPAGE P="62"/>

            <P>(2) In cases where written consent from indebted Volunteers or Trainees cannot be obtained, overseas posts will immediately report the documented debts to VSPS. VSPS may then initiate offset against the readjustment allowance. Prior to offset action, VSPS will notify the debtor Volunteer or Trainee of their rights as required in § 309.32.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Requests for offset to other Federal agencies.</E> The Director or his or her designee may request that a debt owed to the Peace Corps be administratively offset against funds due and payable to a debtor by another Federal agency. In requesting administrative offset, the Peace Corps, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal agency holding funds of the debtor;</P>
            <P>(1) That the debtor owes the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) The amount and basis of the debt; and</P>

The Peace Corps shall initiate the requested offset only upon:</P>
            <P>(1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency:</P>
            <P>(i) That the debtor owes the debt;</P>
            <P>(ii) The amount and basis of the debt;</P>
            <P>(iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and</P>
            <P>(iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102, including providing any required hearing or review.</P>
            <P>(2) A determination by the Peace Corps that collection by offset against funds payable by the Peace Corps would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Civil and Foreign Service Retirement Fund.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, Peace Corps may request that monies that are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Foreign Service Retirement Fund or any other Federal retirement fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments, debts owed the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the respective fund servicing agency in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that agency. The requests for administrative offset will certify in writing the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor owes the United States a debt and the amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) The Peace Corps has complied with applicable regulations and procedures;</P>
            <P>(3) The Peace Corps has followed the requirements of the FCCS as described in this subpart.</P>

            <P>(b) Once Peace Corps decides to request offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it will make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that <PRTPAGE P="63"/>the fund servicing agency may identify and flag the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the fund. This will satisfy any requirements that offset will be initiated prior to expiration of the statute of limitations.</P>
            <P>(c) If Peace Corps collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, Peace Corps shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require or authorize the fund servicing agency to review the merits of Peace Corps’ determination relative to the debt.</P>

            <P>(a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.</P>
            <P>(b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under section 6 of the E.O. by:</P>
            <P>(1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the governmentwide system;</P>
            <P>(2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;</P>
            <P>(3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of “ineligible” in § 310.105), and participants who have voluntarily excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;</P>
            <P>(4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and</P>
            <P>(5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.</P>
            <P>(c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by—</P>
            <P>(1) Providing for the inclusion in the <E T="03">List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs</E> all persons proposed for debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons determined to be ineligible; and</P>
            <P>(2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.</P>
            <P>(d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.</P>

            <P>(a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of these regulations such transactions will be referred to as “covered transactions.”</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Covered transaction.</E> For purposes of these regulations, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Primary covered transaction.</E> Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: Grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lower tier covered transaction.</E> A lower tier covered transaction is:</P>
            <P>(A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a primary covered transaction.</P>
            <P>(B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary covered transaction.</P>
            <P>(C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Principal investigators.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Providers of federally-required audit services.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The following transactions are not covered:</P>
            <P>(i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;</P>

            <P>(ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities consisting wholly or partially <PRTPAGE P="68"/>of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;</P>
            <P>(iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);</P>
            <P>(iv) Federal employment;</P>
            <P>(v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters;</P>
            <P>(vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations would be prohibited by law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Relationship to other sections.</E> This section describes the types of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations will apply. Subpart B, “Effect of Action,” § 310.200, “Debarment or suspension,” sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities described in § 310.110(a). Sections 310.325, “Scope of debarment,” and 310.420, “Scope of suspension,” govern the extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a participant would be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Relationship to Federal procurement activities.</E> In accordance with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or suspension under the FAR.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are appropriate means to implement this policy.</P>
            <P>(b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in these regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.</P>

            <P>(d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.</P>
            <P>(2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central location for submission.</P>
            <P>(3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those located in other State agencies.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which performance is expected to be completed.</P>
            <P>(2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days after award.</P>
            <P>(3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy statement and program shall be in place.</P>

            <P>2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person from participation in this transaction.</P>
            <P>3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default.</P>
            <P>4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</P>

            <P>8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.</P>
            <P>9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</P>

            <P>5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on file in its office and make the information available for Federal inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.</P>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 311.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 311.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence <PRTPAGE P="87"/>made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 311.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 311.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, <E T="03">professional and technical services</E> shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable.

            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
            <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

        <P>(a) An agreement between the Office of Personnel Management and the Agency under the provisions of Executive Order 11219 (3 CFR 1964-65 Comp. p. 303) provides for the noncompetitive appointment of present or former Foreign Service employees as career or career conditional Civil Service employees.</P>
        <P>(b) Under this agreement former career personnel of the Agency's Foreign Service (FSCR, FSRU, FSIO, FSS, FSO, or FP) and such present personnel desiring to transfer, are eligible, under certain conditions, for noncompetitive career or career-conditional appointment in any Federal agency that desires to appoint them. The President has authorized the Office of Personnel Management by executive order to waive the requirements for competitive examination and appointment for such Agency career Foreign Service personnel.</P>
        <P>(c) A present or former Civil Service employee may be appointed on a competitive basis in any Foreign Service class for which the employee has qualified under the provisions of section 3947 of title 22, United States Code.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 501.5</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Mid-level FSO Candidate Program (Class 3, 2, or 1).</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The mid-level FSO Candidate program, under the provisions of section 306 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, supplements the junior-level Career Candidate program to meet total requirements for Foreign Service Officers at the mid-level in the Foreign Service. Foreign Service limited appointments of FSO Candidates are made to Class 3, 2, or 1 for a period not to exceed five years. Occasionally, appointments may be offered at the Class 4 level. The FSO Commissioning Board <PRTPAGE P="108"/>will determine whether FSO Candidates have performed at a satisfactory level and demonstrated the required level of growth potential and competence, and will make a recommendation on commissioning as Foreign Service Officers. FSO Candidates who are not recommended for commissioning prior to the expiration of their limited appointment will be separated from the mid-level program.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Sources of applicants.</E> (1) The United States Information Agency draws a significant number of FSO Candidates from Agency employees who apply, and are found qualified by the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service (BEX).</P>
        <P>(2) The Agency also draws Candidates from outside applicants who possess skills and abilities in short supply in the Foreign Service and who have capabilities, insights, techniques, experiences, and differences of outlook which would serve to enrich the Foreign Service and enable them to perform effectively in assignments both abroad and in the United States. Minority applicants are recruited for mid-level entry under the COMRAT program. Appointment from sources outside the Agency is limited and based on intake levels established in accordance with total USIA FSO workforce and functional requirements. Such appointments are based on successful completion of the examination process, and existing assignment vacancies.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility requirement.</E> (1) <E T="03">USIA Employees.</E> On the date of application, employees must have at least three years of Federal Government service in a position of responsibility in the Agency. A position of responsibility is defined as service as an Overseas Specialist at Class 4 or above or as a Domestic Specialist at GS-11 or above within the Agency. The duties and responsibilities of the position occupied by the applicant must have been similar or closely related to those of a Foreign Service Officer in terms of knowledge, skills, abilities, and overseas experience. Agency Domestic and Overseas Specialists must be no more than 58 years of age on the date of redesignation or appointment as an FSO Candidate.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicants Under Special Recruitment Programs.</E> Minority and women applicants must be no more than 58 years of age, must have approximately nine years of education or experience relevant to work performed in USIA, must be knowledgeable in the social, political and cultural history of the U.S. and be able to analyze and interpret this in elation to U.S. Government policy and American life.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Outside Applicants.</E> On the date of appointment, applicants must be no more than 58 years of age, with nine years of relevant work experience and/or education, or proficiency in a language for which the Agency has a need, or substantial management expertise. Relevant work experience is defined as public relations work, supervisory or managerial positions in communications media, program director for a museum or university-level teacher of political science, history, English or other relevant disciplines. Appointments from these sources for the limited vacancies available are made on a competitive basis to fill specific Service needs after ensuring that the vacancies cannot be filled by Foreign Service Officers already in the Foreign Service Officer Corps.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Application Procedures.</E> (1) Applicants must complete Standard Form 171, Application for Federal Employment; Form DSP-34, Supplement to Application for Federal Employment; a 1,000 word autobiography; a statement affirming willingness and capacity to serve at any post worldwide; and transcripts of all graduate and undergraduate course work and forward them to the Special Recruitment Branch, Office of Personnel (M/PDSE).</P>

        <P>(2) The filing of an application for the Foreign Service does not in itself entitle an applicant to examination. The decision to proceed with an oral examination is made by a Qualifications Evaluation Panel after determining the applicant's eligibility for appointment and reviewing the applicant's qualifications including his/her performance, and administrative files (or equivalents), claimed language proficiency and other background or factors which may be related to the work performed by FSOs. An oral examination is given only in those cases where the applicant is found to possess superior qualifications, proven ability, and high potential for success in the Foreign Service.<PRTPAGE P="109"/>
        </P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Examination process.</E> (1) <E T="03">Written Examination.</E> A written examination will not normally be required of applicants for FSO Candidate appointments. However, if the volume of applications for a given class or classes is such as to make it infeasible to examine applicants orally within a reasonable time, such applicants may be required to take an appropriate written examination prescribed by the Board of Examiners. Those who meet or exceed the passing level set by the Board of Examiners on the written examination will be eligible for selection for the oral examination.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Oral examination.</E> (i) Applicants approved by the Qualifications Evaluation Panel for examination will be given an oral examination by a panel of Deputy Examiners approved by the Board of Examiners. The oral examination is designed to enable the Board of Examiners to determine whether applicants are functionally qualified for work in the Foreign Service at the mid-level, whether they would be suitable representatives abroad of the United States, whether they have the potential to advance in the Foreign Service, and whether they have the background and experience to make a contribution to the Foreign Service. The oral examination is individually scheduled throughout the year and is normally given in Washington, D.C. At the discretion of the Board of Examiners, it may be given in other American cities, or at Foreign Service posts, selected by the Board.</P>
        <P>(ii) The panel will orally examine each applicant through questioning and discussion. There will also be a writing exercise and an in-basket test. Applicants taking the oral examination will be graded according to the standards established by the Board of Examiners. The application of anyone whose score is at or above the passing level set by the Board will be continued. The application of anyone whose score is below the passing level will be terminated. The applicant may, however, reapply in 12 months by submitting a new application.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Foreign language requirement.</E> All applicants who pass the oral examination will be required to take a subsequent test to measure their fluency in foreign languages, or their aptitude for learning them (MLAT) for which a score of 50 points (on a scale of zero to eighty) is necessary to qualify for further processing. No applicant will be recommended for career appointment who has not demonstrated such a proficiency or aptitude. An applicant may be selected, appointed and assigned without first having demonstrated required proficiency in a foreign language, but the appointment will be subject to the condition that the employee may not receive more than one promotion and may not be commissioned as an FSO until proficiency in one foreign language is achieved.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Medical examination.</E> Those applicants recommended by the Board of Examiners for an FSO candidacy, and their dependents who will reside with them overseas, are required to pass a physical examination at the Department of State Medical Division.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Security and suitability considerations.</E> A background investigation or appropriate security clearance update will be conducted on each applicant, and no application may be continued until a security clearance has been granted.</P>
        <P>(6) <E T="03">Class of appointment.</E> The Board of Examiners fixes the entry level for appointment as an FSO candidate.</P>
        <P>(7) <E T="03">Certification for appointment.</E> After completion of all aspects of the examination, the Board of Examiners certifies to the Agency successful candidates for appointment as FSO Candidates. Determinations of duly constituted panels of examiners and deputy examiners are final, unless modified by specific action of the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service.</P>
        <P>(8) <E T="03">FSO Candidate registers.</E> (i) After approval by the Board of Examiners, and certification as to suitability and security clearance by the Agency's Director of Security, successful applicants will have their names placed on a register for the class for which they have been found qualified. Appointments to available openings will be made from the applicants entered on the register for the class of the position to be filled. Inclusion on the register does not guarantee eventual assignment and appointment as an FSO <PRTPAGE P="110"/>Candidate. Applicants who have qualified but have not been appointed because of lack of openings will be dropped from the register 18 months after the date of placement on it (or the completion of an inside applicant's current overseas tour, whichever is longer). Such applicants may reapply for the program, but will be required to repeat the entire application process, including BEX testing.</P>
        <P>(ii) Any applicant on the register who refuses an assignment offer will be removed from the Register and will not be eligible to reapply for the program for seven years.</P>
        <P>(iii) The Board of Examiners may extend the eligibility period when such extension is in its judgment justified in the interest of the Foreign Service.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Appointment as an FSO Candidate.</E> (1) An FSO Candidate will be given a four-year Foreign Service limited appointment. Agency Career Overseas Specialists will be redesignated as FSO Candidates for a period of four years. The appointment or redesignation may be extended for one year, but must be terminated at the end of the fifth year. The purpose of the FSO Candidacy is to permit on-the-job evaluation of an individual's suitability and capacity for effective service as a Foreign Service Officer.</P>
        <P>(2) FSO Candidates will be assigned to Generalist positions overseas, and will compete for promotion with other Generalist officers under the Annual Generalist Selection Boards. FSO Candidates at the Class 1 level may not compete for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service prior to commissioning as an FSO.</P>
        <P>(3) The FSO Candidacy may be terminated during the four-year period for unsatisfactory performance (22 U.S.C. 4011) or for such other cause as will promote the efficiency of the Service (22 U.S.C. 4010).</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Commissioning as a Foreign Service Officer.</E> (1) Upon completion of three years’ service (most of which will have been overseas), the FSO Candidate will be eligible for commissioning as a Foreign Service Officer. The FSO Commissioning Board will review all FSO Candidates appointed on or after March 1, 1980 and will recommend on tenure.</P>
        <P>(2) The criterion used for deciding whether to recommend commissioning of FSO Candidates is the Candidate's demonstrated potential to perform effectively as a Foreign Service Officer in a normal range of generalist assignments up through the Class 1 level. No quota or numerical limit is placed on the number of affirmative decisions.</P>
        <P>(3) If recommended for commissioning, and having satisfied the language proficiency requirements, the name of the FSO Candidate will be forwarded to the President and the Senate and, upon approval, the FSO Candidate will be commissioned as an FSO.</P>
        <P>(4) If the FSO Commissioning Board does not recommend commissioning of the FSO Candidate during its review, it may recommend extension of the FSO Candidacy to allow for a future review. Under no circumstances will an FSO Candidacy be extended to a total of more than five years.</P>
        <P>(5) Candidates not recommended for commissioning or who have not satisfied the language proficiency requirement will be separated from the Service at the expiration of their appointment. However, FSO Candidates who were appointed from within the Agency with career status as a Domestic or Overseas Specialist may exercise reappointment rights to their previous category in lieu of separation.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Appointment of Overseas Specialists.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Members of the Agency's Foreign Service appointed as Overseas Specialists serve on rotational U.S.-overseas assignments in the following types of positions: General Administration; Publication Writers and Editors; Exhibit Managers; Printing Specialists; English Teaching Specialists; Correspondents; Engineers for the Voice of America; Regional Librarian Consultants; and Secretaries. Appointees serve a trial period of service as Specialist Candidates under Foreign Service limited appointments (or redesignation) for a period not to exceed five years. Appointments are made to F.S. classes 8 through 1. Specialist Candidates are given career appointments as Overseas Specialists based on the recommendations of Specialist Selection Boards. Specialist candidates not recommended <PRTPAGE P="111"/>for tenuring will be separated from the Foreign Service, or reinstated in the Civil Service.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Sources of applicants.</E> Qualified USIA domestic employees comprise a significant recruitment source for Overseas Specialist appointments. Such employees will be given priority consideration over outside applicants when applying for Overseas Specialist positions, when qualifications are otherwise equal.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility requirements.</E> All applicant must be citizens of the United States, and must be at least 21 years of age and no more than 58 years of age at the time of appointment. The 21-year age requirement may be waived by the Director, Office of Personnel (M/P or VOA/P) when she or he determines that the applicant's services are urgently needed. USIA employee applicants must also have at least three years of Federal government experience and occupy a position at the GS-11 level (or equivalent) or above (GS-10 for Electronic Technicians in the Voice of America). All applicants must be available for worldwide assignment to positions in their occupational category.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Application procedures.</E> (1) Applications for all specialties except secretarial should include a current SF-171, Application for Federal Employment; a DSP-34, Supplement to Application for Federal Employment; university transcripts; a 1,000 word autobiographical statement which should include mention of the qualifications the applicant would bring to the job and reason for desiring to work for the Agency; and a statement affirming willingness and capacity to serve at any post worldwide.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Special requirements for Foreign Service Secretaries.</E> Secretarial applicants must submit a current SF-171, Application for Federal Employment, and a 250 word essay on a commonly understood subject to demonstrate grammatical competence. The following specific requirements must be met by applicants: Ability to type accurately at 60 words per minute; four years of secretarial or administrative experience (business school or college training may be substituted for up to two years of required work experience); and attainment of an acceptable score in verbal ability and spelling tests. Applicants will subsequently be given a written examination to measure administrative aptitude.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Examination process</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application review.</E> All applications are to be sent to the Special Recruitment Staff, Office of Personnel (M/PDSE), or to the Foreign Personnel Advisor (VOA/PF) for Voice of America positions.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Qualifications Evaluation Panel.</E> A Qualifications Evaluation Panel will evaluate the applicant's qualifications including his/her performance and administrative files (or equivalent), claimed language proficiency and other background or factors which may be related to the work performed by an Overseas Specialist Officer in the relevant specialty.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Oral examination.</E> (i) Applicants who are passed on by the Qualifications Evaluation Panel to the Board of Examiners will be given an oral examination to evaluate the applicant's total qualifications for service as an Overseas Specialist in the desired functional specialty.</P>
        <P>(ii) The Board panel examining all candidates except those of the Voice of America will consist of one USIA Overseas Specialist and two BEX Deputy Examiners. For VOA candidates, the panel will consist of the Foreign Personnel Advisor, a BEX Deputy Examiner assigned to the Voice of America, and a Deputy Examiner assigned to the Board of Examiners.</P>
        <P>(iii) The panel will examine each applicant through questioning and discussion. Hypothetical problem-solving exercises, a writing exercise and an in-basket test may also be required. The panel will also recommend the F.S. entry level for appointment. If the panel's recommendation is unfavorable, the application process will be discontinued. An unsuccessful applicant may apply again in 12 months.</P>
        <P>(4) The same medical and security requirements applicable to FSO Candidates pertain to Specialist Candidates.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Overseas Specialist Candidate register.</E> If an applicant is successful in the examination, and medical and security clearances have been successfuly completed, his/her name will be added to the appropriate Overseas Specialist <PRTPAGE P="112"/>register for a period of 18 months, or completion of an inside candidate's current tour of duty overseas, whichever is longer, at the Foreign Service class determined in the examination process and based on previous experience. Inclusion on the register does not guarantee eventual assignment and appointment as an Overseas Specialist Candidate.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Appointment as a Specialist Candidate.</E> (1) When the Office of Personnel identifies an overseas vacancy which cannot be filled from the existing ranks of Overseas Specialists, applicants on the Overseas Specialist register will be considered for the assignment. An applicant will not be appointed unless an overseas position has been identified and a need for the individual in the Foreign Service has been certified by the Director, Office of Personnel (M/P or VOA/P). Any applicant selected from the register who refuses an assignment offer will be dropped from the register and precluded from reapplying for a period of seven years.</P>
        <P>(2) Applicants will be given a Foreign Service limited appointment (or redesignation) for a period of four years at the Foreign Service Class determined in the examination process. The purpose of this untenured appointment is to allow the Agency to evaluate and assess the Specialist Candidate's abilities and future potential prior to offering career appointment as an Overseas Specialist. The limited appointment may be extended for one additional year, but must be terminated at the end of the fifth year if the Candidate does not obtain career tenure.</P>
        <P>(3) The Candidate will receive the orientation and training necessary to serve overseas and will be assigned overseas in a position in his or her specialty. USIA Civil Service employees selected as Overseas Specialist Candidates will be appointed only if the Agency element to which they are currently assigned is willing to affirm in writing that a position at the appropriate level will be made available for the employee should the candidacy end unsuccessfully. USIA Civil Service applicants will be appointed as Overseas Specialist Candidates on or about the date of their departure for post of assignment or upon assumption of an assignment (which has been identified and will follow a period of orientation in Washington). The Agency may also assign a Candidate to a U.S.-based position for an initial assignment of up to 24 months when the Candidate will spend the majority of his/her time traveling overseas and will, except for the U.S. basing, be fully functioning as an Overseas Specialist. Specialist Candidates will compete for promotion by the Annual Overseas Specialist Selection Board with other officers in the same specialty and at the same class level. Specialist Candidates at the Class 1 level are ineligible for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service.</P>
        <P>(4) The Specialist candidacy may be terminated a any time for unsatisfactory performance (22 U.S.C. 4011) or for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the Service (22 U.S.C. 4010).</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Career appointment as an Overseas Specialist.</E> In accordance with section 3946 of title 22 United States Code, the decision to offer a Specialist Candidate a career appointment will be based on the recommendation made by the Annual Overseas Specialist Selection Board which reviews all employees in the Candidate's occupational category and class level.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> Specialist Candidates who have performed at least two years of overseas service will be eligible for review for career status at the time of the Candidate's third Board review. Candidates serving an initial tour in the U.S. but spending the majority of time working overseas will be credited with up to one year's overseas service, but no more than half of the time based in the U.S. If a Specialist Candidate is not recommended for career status during the initial review, the Candidate may be reviewed again when the next Annual Overseas Specialist Selection Board convenes if the initial Board so recommends.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Selection Board Review.</E> The Selection Board(s) will review the official performance file of the eligible Specialist Candidates and in accordance with established precepts, will determine whether the Candidates should be recommended for career appointment as Overseas Specialists. Recommendations by the Board will be based on the <PRTPAGE P="113"/>Candidate's demonstrated aptitude and fitness for a career in the Foreign Service in their occupational specialties. No quota or numerical limit is placed on the number of positive career status decisions that can be made by Selection Boards. The Specialist candidacy will be terminated if the Candidate fails to be recommended for career status after a second Board review for tenuring. Candidates may be terminated earlier than the expiration of their limited appointment if so recommended by the Board and approved by the Director, Office of Personnel (M/P or VOA/P). Specialist Candidates recommended for career status by the Selection Board will be given Foreign Service career appointments (or redesignation) as Overseas Specialist, to take effect within one month of the Board's recommendation.</P>

        <NOTE>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
          <P> This requirement will not apply where it has been determined by the Foreign Service Grievance Board under 3 FAM 660 or by the Director, Office of Personnel, that the separation or the resignation or retirement in lieu of selection out or separation for cause was wrongful; where reappointment is determined by the Director, Office of Personnel, as an appropriate means to settle a grievance or complaint of a former Foreign Service career member on a mutually satisfactory basis; or where reappointment is the indicated redress in a proceeding under 3 FAM 130 “Equal Employment Opportunity.” </P>
        </NOTE>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Application.</E> Apply by letter addressed to the Director, Office of Personnel. Include the standard application forms, SF-171, Application for Federal Employment; and DSP-34, Supplement to Application for Federal Employment; and a brief resume of work and other experience since resignation from the Foreign Service. Whenever the Director, Office of Personnel, finds that the reappointment of one or more former Foreign Service Career Members may be in the best interest of the Service, all application forms, along with the available personnel files, will be referred as appropriate to the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service which will conduct an advisory evaluation of the qualifications of each applicant.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Nature of evaluation.</E> (1) The Board of Examiners’ advisory qualifications evaluation of FSO applicants (i) will be based on a review of all pertinent information relating to the applicant's record of employment in the Foreign Service and to subsequent experience, as well, and (ii) will take into consideration among other factors, the rank of the applicant's contemporaries in the <PRTPAGE P="114"/>Service in recommending the class in which the applicant will be reappointed under section 308 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980.</P>
        <P>(2) In consultation with the Foreign Service Personnel Division (M/PF or VOA/PF) and officials from the pertinent Agency elements, the Overseas Specialist applicant's total qualifications and experience will be evaluated based on the application and an interview. On the basis of this review and the recommendations of the appropriate officials, the personnel office will determine whether the application should be continued and, if so, will recommend the appointment class.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Medical examination and security investigation.</E> Qualified applicants and their dependents who will accompany them overseas will be given a physical examination. A security investigation will also be conducted. The reappointment action is subject to completion of a satisfactory security investigation and satisfactory medical examination of the applicant and his/her dependents.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Selection for reappointment.</E> The Director, Office or Personnel (M/P or VOA/P), taking into consideration (1) the qualifications and experience of each applicant as outlined in the qualifications evaluation performed by the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service or the personnel office, (2) future placement and growth potential, and (3) the needs of the Service for the applicant's skills determines which applicant, or applicants, are qualified for reappointment and the appointment class that is considered to be appropriate. An Overseas Specialist may not be reappointed until and unless an overseas assignment has been identified. The Director, Office of Personnel (M/P or VOA/P) is responsible for initiating appointment action. Any voluntary applicant who refuses an offer of reappointment will not be considered for reappointment again.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
        <P>The United States Information Agency administers the “Beirut Agreement of 1948”, a multinational treaty formally known as the Agreement for Facilitating the International Circulation of Visual and Auditory Material of an Educational, Scientific and Cultural Character. This Agreement facilitates the free flow of educational, scientific and cultural audio-visual materials between nations by providing favorable import treatment through the elimination or reduction of import duties, licenses, taxes, or restrictions. The United States and other participating governments facilitate this favorable import treatment through the issuance or authentication of a certificate that the audio-visual material for which favorable treatment is sought conforms with criteria set forth in the Agreement.</P>

        <P>(a) The Agency shall certify or authenticate audio-visual materials submitted for review as educational, scientific and cultural in character and in compliance with the standards set forth in Article I of the Beirut Agreement when: (1) Their primary purpose or effect is to instruct or inform through the development of a subject or aspect of a subject, or when their content is such as to maintain, increase or diffuse knowledge, and augment international understanding and goodwill; and</P>
        <P>(2) The materials are representative, authentic, and accurate; and</P>
        <P>(3) The technical quality is such that it does not interfere with the use made of the material.</P>

        <P>(c) In its administration of this section, the Agency shall not fail to qualify audio-visual material because:</P>
        <P>(1) It advocates a particular position or viewpoint, whether or not it presents or acknowledges opposing viewpoints;</P>
        <P>(2) It might lend itself to misinterpretation, or to misrepresentation of the United States or other countries, or their people or institutions;</P>

        <P>(4) It does not augment international understanding and goodwill, unless its primary purpose or effect is not to instruct or inform through the development of a subject or an aspect of a subject and its content is not such as to maintain, increase, or diffuse knowledge; or</P>
        <P>(5) In the opinion of the agency the material is propaganda.</P>

        <P>(d) The Agency may certify or authenticate materials which have not <PRTPAGE P="117"/>been produced at the time of application upon an affirmative determination that:</P>

        <P>(ii) Such materials will be similar to the representative samples provided to the Agency on application; and</P>
        <P>(iii) The applicant will provide the Agency with copies of the items themselves or descriptive materials for post-certification review.</P>
        <P>(e) If the Agency determines through a post-certification review that the materials do not comply with the substantive criteria for certification delineated at paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the applicant will no longer be eligible for serial certifications. Ineligibility for serial certifications will not affect an applicant's eligibility for certification of materials reviewed prior to production.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Introduction and definitions.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Introduction. The FOIA and this part apply to all records of the United States Information Agency, including all of its foreign posts. As a general policy, USIA follows a balanced approach in administering the FOIA. We recognize the right of public access to information in the possession of the Agency, but we also protect the integrity of the Agency's internal processes. This policy calls for the fullest possible disclosure of records consistent with those requirements of administrative necessity and confidentiality which are recognized by the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>(b) Definitions—<E T="03">Access Appeal Committee</E> or <E T="03">Committee</E>, means the Committee delegated by the Agency Director for making final Agency determinations regarding appeals from the initial denial of records under the FOIA.

          <E T="03">Agency</E> or <E T="03">USIA</E> means the United States Information Agency. It includes all components of USIA in the U.S. and all foreign posts abroad (known as the U.S. Information Service or USIS). (See 22 CFR part 504, chapter V—Organization.)<PRTPAGE P="119"/>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Commercial use</E>, when referring to a request, means that the request is from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request is made. Whether a request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and the use to which the records will be put. The identity of the requester (individual, non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), or the nature of the records, while in some cases indicative of that purpose or use, is not necessarily determinative. When a request is from a representative of the news media, the request shall be deemed not to be for commercial use.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Department</E> means any executive department, military department, government corporation, government controlled corporation, any independent regulatory agency, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Federal Government. A private organization is not a department even if it is performing work under contract with the Government or is receiving Federal financial assistance. Grantee and contractor records are not subject to the FOIA unless they are in the possession and control of USIA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process making a copy of a record and sending it to the requester, to the extent necessary to respond to the request. Such copies include paper copy, microform, audiovisual materials, and magnetic tapes, cards and discs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, elementary or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institution of professional or vocational education.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">FOIA</E> means section 552 of title 5, United States Code, as amended.</P>
        <P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated substantially for purposes of furthering its own or someone else's business, trade, or profit interests, and that is operated for purposes of conducting scientific research whose results are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Post</E> or <E T="03">USIS</E> means all overseas offices of the USIA.</P>

It does not include objects or articles such as exhibits, models, equipment, and duplication machines or audiovisual processing materials. Nor does it include books, magazines, pamphlets, or other reference material in formally organized and officially designated USIA libraries, where such materials are available under the rules of the particular library.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means a person actively gathering news for an entity organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public.“News” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. News media entities include television and radio broadcasters, publishers of periodicals (to the extent they publish “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public, and entities that may disseminate news through other media (e.g., electronic dissemination of text). Freelance journalists shall be considered representatives of a news media entity if they can show a solid basis for expecting publication through such an entity. A publication contract or a requester's past publication record may show such a basis.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Request</E> means asking in writing for records whether or not the request refers specifically to the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Review</E> means examining the records to determine which portions, if any, may be released, and any other processing that is necessary to prepare the records for release. It includes only the first examination and processing of the requested documents for purposes of <PRTPAGE P="120"/>determining whether a specific exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Search</E> means looking for records or portions of records responsive to a request. It includes reading and interpreting a request, and also page-by-page and line-by-line examination to identify responsive portions of a document. However, it does not include line-by-line examination where merely duplicating the entire page would be a less expensive and a quicker way to comply with the request.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Making a request.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">How to request records.</E> All requests for documents shall be made in writing. Requests should be addressed to the United States Information Agency, Freedom of Information Officer, GC/FOI, room M-301 4th Street SW., Washington, DC 20547. Write the words “Freedom of Information Act Request” on the envelope and letter.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Details in your letter.</E> Your request for documents should provide as many details as possible that will help us find the records you are requesting. If there is insufficient information, we will ask you for more. Include your telephone number(s) to help us reach you if we have questions. If you are not sure how to write your request or what details to include, you may call the FOIA Office. The more specific the request for documents, the faster the Agency will be able to respond to your requests.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests not handled under FOIA.</E> We will not provide documents requested under the FOIA and this part if the records are currently available in the National Archives, subject to release through the Archives, or commonly sold to the public by it or another agency pursuant to statutory authority (for example, records currently available from the Government Printing Office or the National Technical Information Service). Agency records that are normally freely available to the general public, such as USIA World, are not covered by the FOIA. Also requests from Federal departments and court orders for documents are not FOIA requests, nor are requests from Chairmen of Congressional committees or subcommittees.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Referral of requests outside the agency.</E> If you request records that were created by or provided to us by another Federal department, we may refer your request to or consult with that department. We may also refer requests for classified records to the department that classified them. In cases of referral, the other department is responsible for processing and responding to your request under that department's regulation. When possible, we will notify you when we refer your request to another department.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Responding to your request—</E>(1) <E T="03">Retrieving records.</E> The Agency is required to furnish copies of records only when they are in our possession and control. If we have stored the records you want in a records retention center, we will retrieve and review them for possible disclosure. However, the Federal Government destroys many old records, so sometimes it is impossible to fill requests. The Agency's record retention policies are set forth in the General Records Schedules of the National Archives and Records Administration and in USIA's Records Disposition Schedule, which establish time periods for keeping records before they may be destroyed.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Furnishing records.</E> The Agency is only required to furnish copies of records which we have or can retrieve; we are not compelled to create new records. For example, if the requested information is maintained in computerized form and we can, with minimal computer instructions, produce the information on paper, we will do so—if this is the only way to respond to a request. We are not, however, required to write a new computer program in order to print documentary material in a format you might prefer.</P>

        <FP>On the other hand, we may decide to conserve government resources and at the same time supply the records you need by consolidating information from various records rather than copying them all. The Agency is required to furnish only one copy of a record. If we are unable to make a legible copy of a record to be released, we will not attempt to reconstruct it. Rather we will furnish the best copy possible and note its poor quality in our reply or on the copy. If material exists in different <PRTPAGE P="121"/>forms, we will provide the record in the form that best conserves government resources. For example, if it requires less time and expense to provide a computer record as a paper printout rather than on tape, we will provide the printout.</FP>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Release of records.</E> If we have released a record or part of a record to others in the past, we will ordinarily release it to you also. This principle does not apply if the previous release was an unauthorized disclosure. However, we will not release it to you if a statute forbids this disclosure and we will not necessarily release it to you if an exemption applies in your situation and did not apply or applied differently in the previous situations.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Denial of requests.</E> All denials are in writing and describe in general terms the material withheld and state the reasons for the denial, including a reference to the specific exemption of the FOIA authorizing the withholding or deletion. The denial also explains your right to appeal the decision and it will identify the official to whom you should send the appeal. Denial letters are signed by the person who made the decision to deny all or part of the request, unless otherwise noted.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Unproductive searches.</E> We make a diligent search for records to satisfy your request. Nevertheless, we may not be able always to find the records you want using the information you provided, or they may not exist. If we advise you that we have been unable to find the records despite a diligent search, you will nevertheless be provided the opportunity to appeal the adequacy of the Agency's search. However, if your request is for records that are obviously not connected with this Agency or your request has been provided to us in error, a “no records” response will not be considered an adverse action and you will not be provided an opportunity to appeal.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Appeal of denials.</E> You have the right to appeal a partial of full denial of your FOIA request. To do so, you must put your appeal in writing and address it to the official identified in the denial letter. Your appeal letter must be dated and postmarked within 30 calendar days from the date of the Agency's denial letter. Because we have some discretionary authority in deciding whether to release or withhold records, you may strengthen your appeal by explaining your reasons for wanting the records. However, you are not required to give any explanation. Your appeal will be reviewed by the Agency's Access Appeal Committee which consists of senior Agency officials. When the Committee responds to your appeal, that constitutes the Agency's final action on the request. If the Access Appeal Committee grants your appeal in part or in full, we will send the records to you promptly or set up an appointment for you to inspect them. If the decision is to deny your appeal in part or in full, the final letter will state the reasons for the decision, name the officials responsible for the decision, and inform you of the FOIA provisions for judicial review.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Time limits.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The FOIA sets certain time limits for us to decide whether to disclose the records you requested, and to decide appeals. If we fail to meet the deadlines, you may proceed as if we had denied your request or your appeal. Since requests may be misaddressed or misrouted, you should call or write to confirm that we have the request and to learn its status if you have not heard from us in a reasonable time.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Time allowed.</E> (1) We will decide whether to release records within 10 working days after your request reaches the appropriate area office that maintains the records you are requesting. When we decide to release records, we will actually provide the records at that time, or as soon as possible after that decision, or let you inspect them as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P>(2) We will decide an appeal within 20 working days after the appeal reaches the appropriate reviewing official.</P>

        <P>(3) The FOI Officer or appeal official may extend the time limits in unusual circumstances for initial requests or appeals, up to 10 working days. We will notify you in writing of any extensions. “Unusual circumstances” include situations where we: Search for <PRTPAGE P="122"/>and collect records from field facilities, records centers or locations other than the office processing the records; search for, collect, or examine a great many records in response to a single request; consult with another office or department that has substantial interest in the determination of the request; and/or conduct negotiations with submitters and requesters of information to determine the nature and extent of non-disclosable proprietary materials.</P>

This includes films, radio scripts and tapes, video tapes, books, and similar materials produced by the Agency.

        <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees to be charged—categories of requests.</E> The paragraphs below state, for each category of request, the type of fees that we will generally charge. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the reasons given in paragraph (e) of this section. “Request” means asking for records, whether or not you refer specifically to the Freedom of Information Act. Requests from Federal agencies and court orders for documents are not included within this definition. “Review” means, when used in connection with processing records for a commercial use request, examining the records to determine what portions, if any, may be withheld, and any other processing that is necessary to prepare the records for release. It includes only the examining and processing that are done the first time we analyze whether a specific exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. It does not include the process of researching or resolving general legal or policy issues regarding exemptions. “Search” means looking for records or portions of records responsive to a request. It includes reading and interpreting a request, and also page-by-page and line-by-line examination to identify responsive portions of a document.<PRTPAGE P="123"/>
        </P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request.</E> If your request is for a commercial use, USIA will charge you the costs of search, review and duplication. “Commercial use” means that the request is from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request is made. Whether a request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and the use to which the records will be put; the identity of the requester (individual, non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), or the nature of the records, while in some cases indicative of that purpose or use, is not necessarily determinative. When a request is from a representative of the news media, a purpose of use supporting the requester's news dissemination function is not a commercial use.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and scientific institutions and news media.</E> If you are an educational institution or a non-commercial scientific institution, operated primarily for scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and your request is not for a commercial use, USIA will charge you only for the duplication of documents. Also, USIA will not charge you the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication. “Educational institution” means a preschool, elementary or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institution of professional or vocational education. “Non-commercial scientific institution” means an institution that is not operated substantially for purposes of furthering its own or someone else's business, trade, or profit interests, and that is operated for purposes of conducting scientific research whose results are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. “Representative of the news media” means a person actively gathering news for an entity organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. “News” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. News media entities include television and radio broadcasters, publishers of periodicals (to the extent they publish “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public, and entities that may disseminate news through other media (e.g., electronic dissemination of text). We will treat freelance journalists as representatives of a news media entity if they can show a solid basis for expecting publication through such an entity. A publication contract is such a basis, and the requester's past publication record may show such a basis.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Other requesters.</E> If your request is not the kind described by paragraph (a)(1) of this section or paragraph (a)(2) of this section, then USIA will charge you only for the search and the duplication. Also, we will not charge you for the first two hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of duplication.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees to be charged—general provisions.</E> (1) We may charge search fees even if the records we find are exempt from disclosure, or even if we do not find any records at all.</P>
        <P>(2) We will not charge you any fee at all if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. We have estimated that cost to be $5.00.</P>
        <P>(3) If we determine that you are (acting alone or with others) breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid or reduce the fees charged, we may aggregate all these requests for purposes of calculating the fees charged.</P>
        <P>(4) We will charge interest on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day following the day the bill was sent. The accrual of interest will be stayed upon receipt of the fee, rather than upon its processing by USIA. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 32 U.S.C.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee schedule—USIA will charge the following fees:</E> (1) Manual searching for or reviewing of records: (i) When performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8 or FS-9 through FS-6—an hourly rate of $10.00 will be charged;</P>
        <P>(ii) When performed by employees at grade GS-9 through GS-13 or FS-5 through FS-2—an hourly rate of $20.00 will be charged;</P>

        <P>(iii) When performed by employees at grade GS-14 or above or FS-2 or <PRTPAGE P="124"/>above—an hourly rate of $36.00 will be charged.</P>
        <P>(iv) When a search involves employees at more than one of these levels, we will charge the appropriate rate for each.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer searching and printing.</E> The actual cost of operating the computer plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) Photocopying standard size pages—$0.15 per page.</P>
        <P>(4) Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or blueprints) or reproducing other records (such as tapes)—the actual cost of operating the machine, plus the actual cost of the materials used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(5) Certifying that records are true copies—this service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge $10.00 per certification.</P>
        <P>(6) Sending records by express mail, certified mail, or other special methods. This service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge our actual cost.</P>
        <P>(7) Performing any other special service that you request and to which we agree—actual cost of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of any materials used, plus charges for the time of our employees, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures for assessing and collecting fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Agreement to pay.</E> We generally assume that when you request records you are willing to pay the fees we charge for services associated with your request. You may specify a limit on the amount you are willing to spend. We will notify you if it appears that the fees will exceed the limit and ask whether you nevertheless want us to proceed with the search.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> If you have failed to pay previous bills in a timely manner, or if our initial review of your request indicates that we will charge you fees exceeding $250.00, we will require you to pay your past due fees and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before we start searching for the records you want, or before we send them to you. In such cases, the administrative time limits as described in section 503.6(b) above, will begin only after we come to an agreement with you over payment of fees, or decide that fee waiver or reduction is appropriate.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> We will waive or reduce the fees we would otherwise charge if disclosure of the information meets both of the following tests (paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section):</P>
        <P>(1) It is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities, regardless of any other public interest it may further. In making this determination, we may consider:</P>
        <P>(i) Whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public understanding;</P>
        <P>(ii) Whether the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the information; and,</P>
        <P>(iii) Whether the requester's intended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the information among the public, and</P>
        <P>(2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Commercial interests include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Not only profit-making corporations have commercial interests; so do nonprofit corporations, individuals, unions, and other associations.</P>
        <P>(3) You must make your request for a waiver or reduction at the same time you make your request for records. Only the FOL Officer may make the decision whether to waive or reduce the fees. If we do not completely grant your request for a waiver or reduction, the denial letter will designate the appeal official.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>

        <P>Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptions to the mandatory disclosure of records. These exemptions and their application by the Agency are described below. In some cases, more than one exemption may apply to the same document. This section does not itself authorize the giving of any <PRTPAGE P="125"/>pledge of confidentiality by any officer or employee of the Agency.</P>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemption one—National defense and foreign policy.</E> We are not required to release records that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order. Executive Order No. 12356 (1982) provides for such classification. When the release of certain records may adversely affect U.S. relations with foreign countries, we usually consult with officials of those area offices and/or with officials of the Department of State. We may also have in our possession records classified by another agency. If we do, we may consult with that agency or may refer your request to that agency for their direct response to you, in which case we will notify you that we have made such a referral.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemption two—Internal personnel rules and practices.</E> We are not required to release records that are related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. We may withhold routine internal agency procedures such as guard schedules and luncheon periods. We may also withhold internal records the release of which would help some persons circumvent the law or agency regulations.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemption three</E>—<E T="03">Records exempted by other statutes.</E> We are not required to release records if another statute specifically allows us to withhold them. Another statute may be used only if it absolutely prohibits disclosure or if it sets forth criteria identifying particular types of material to be withheld.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemption four</E>—<E T="03">Trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information.</E> We will withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Trade secrets.</E> A trade secret is a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. A direct relationship is necessary between the trade secret and the productive process.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Commercial or financial information, obtained from a person, and is privileged or confidential.</E>
        </P>
        <P>(i) Information is “commercial or financial” if it relates to businesses, commerce, trade, employment, profits, or finances (including personal finances).</P>
        <P>(ii) Information is obtained from someone outside the Federal Government or from someone within the Government who has a commercial or financial interest in the information. “Person” includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, state or foreign government, or other organization. Information is not “obtained from a person” if it is generated by USIA or another Federal agency.</P>
        <P>(iii) Information is “privileged” if it would ordinarily be protected from disclosure in civil discovery by a recognized evidentiary privilege, such as the attorney-client privilege, or the work product privilege. Information may be privileged for this purpose under a privilege belonging to a person outside the Government, unless the providing of the information to the Government rendered the information no longer protectible in civil discovery.</P>
        <P>(iv) Information is “confidential” if it meets one of the following tests:</P>
        <P>(A) Disclosure may impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future;</P>
        <P>(B) Disclosure would substantially harm the competitive position of the person who submitted the information;</P>
        <P>(C) Disclosure would impair other Government interests, such as program effectiveness and compliance; or</P>
        <P>(D) Disclosure would impair other private interests, such as an interest in controlling availability of intrinsically valuable records, which are sold in the market by their owner.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Designation of certain confidential information.</E> A person who submits records to the Government may designate part or all of the information in such records as exempt from disclosure under Exemption four. The person may make this designation either at the time the records are submitted to the Government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must be in writing. The legend prescribed by a request for proposal or request for <PRTPAGE P="126"/>quotations pursuant to any agency regulation establishing a substitute for the language is sufficient but not necessary for this purpose. Any such designation will expire ten years after the records were submitted to the Government.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Predisclosure notification.</E> The procedures in this paragraph apply to records that were submitted to the Government where we have substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered exempt under Exemption four. Certain exceptions to these procedures are stated in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</P>
        <P>(i) When we receive a request for such records and we determine that we may be required to disclose them, we will make reasonable efforts to notify the submitter about these facts. The notice will inform the submitter about the procedures and time limits for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. If we must notify a large number of submitters, we may do this by posting or publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are reasonably likely to become aware of it.</P>
        <P>(ii) The submitter has five (5) working days from receipt of the notice to object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all bases for its objections.</P>
        <P>(iii) We will give consideration to all bases that have been timely stated by the submitter. If we decide to disclose the records and the submitter still does not agree, we will send a written notice to the submitter stating briefly why we did not sustain its objections and will provide a copy of the records as we intend to release them. The notice will state that we will disclose the records five (5) working days after the submitter receives the notice unless we are ordered by a United States District Court not to release them.</P>
        <P>(iv) When a requester files suit under the FOIA to obtain records covered by this paragraph, we will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
        <P>(v) Whenever we send a notice to a submitter under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, we will notify the requester that we are giving the submitter a notice and an opportunity to object.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Exceptions to predisclosure notification.</E> The notice requirements in paragraph (d)(4) of this section do not appy in the following situations:</P>
        <P>(i) We decide not to disclose the records;</P>
        <P>(ii) The information has previously been published or made generally available;</P>
        <P>(iii) We have already notified the submitter of previous requests for the same records and have come to an understanding with that submitter about the records;</P>
        <P>(iv) Disclosure is required by a statute other than the FOIA;</P>
        <P>(v) Disclosure is required by a regulation, issued after notice and opportunity for public comment, that specifies narrow categories of records that are to be disclosed under the FOIA, but in this case a submitter may still designate records as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and in exceptional cases, at our discretion, may follow the notice procedures in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;</P>
        <P>(vi) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this case we will still give the submitter the written notice required by paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section (although this notice need not explain our decision or include a copy of the records).</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemption five</E>—Internal memoranda. This exemption covers internal Government communications and notes that fall within a generally recognized evidentiary privilege. Internal Govenment communications include an agency's communications with an outside consultant or other outside person, with a court, or with Congress, when those communications are for a purpose similar to the purpose of privileged intra-agency communications. Some of the most common applicable privileges are:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">The deliberative process privilege.</E> This privilege protects predecisional deliberative communications. A communication is protected under this privilege if it was made before a final decision was reached on some question of policy and if it expressed recommendations or opinions on that question. The purpose of this privilege is to prevent injury to the quality of the agency decisionmaking process by <PRTPAGE P="127"/>encouraging open and frank internal policy discussions, by avoiding premature disclosure of policies not yet adopted, and by avoiding the public confusion that might result from disclosing reasons that were not in fact the ultimate grounds for an agency's decision. This privilege continues to protect predecisional documents even after a decision is made. We will release purely factual material in a deliberative document unless that material is otherwise exempt. However, purely factual material in a deliberative document is within this privilege if:</P>
        <P>(i) It is inextricably intertwined with the deliberative portions so that it cannot reasonably be segregated, or</P>
        <P>(ii) It would reveal the nature of the deliberative portions, or</P>
        <P>(iii) Its disclosure would in some other way make possible an intrusion into the decisionmaking process.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Attorney-client privilege.</E> This privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and an employee or agent of the Government where an attorney-client relationship exists (e.g., where the lawyer is acting as attorney for the agency and the employee is communicating on behalf of the agency) and where the employee has communicated information to the attorney in confidence in order to obtain legal advice or assistance, and/or where the attorney has given advice to the client.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Attorney work product privilege.</E> This privilege protects documents prepared by or for an agency, or by or for its representative (usually USIA attorneys) in anticipation of litigation or for trial. It includes documents prepared for purposes of administrative adjudications as well as court litigation. It includes documents prepared by program offices as well as by attorneys. It includes factual material in such documents as well as material revealing opinions and tactics. The privilege continues to protect the documents even after the litigation is closed.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemption six—Clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</E> We may withhold personnel, medical, and similar files and personal information about individuals if disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Balancing test.</E> In deciding whether to release records that contain personal or private information about someone else to a requester, we weigh the foreseeable harm of invading that individual's privacy against the public benefit that would result from the release of the information. In our evaluation of requests for records, we attempt to guard against the release of information that might involve a violation of personal privacy by a requester being able to “piece together items” or “read between the lines” information that would normally be exempt from mandatory disclosure.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Information frequently withheld.</E> We frequently withhold such information as home addresses, ages, minority group status, social security numbers, individual's benefits, earning records, leave records, etc.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Exemption seven—Law enforcement.</E> We are not required to release information or records that the Government has compiled for law enforcement purposes. The records may apply to actual or potential violations of either criminal or civil laws or regulations. We can withhold these records only to the extent that releasing them would cause harm in at least one of the following situations:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Enforcement proceedings.</E> We may withhold information when release could reasonably be expected to interfere with prospective or ongoing law enforcement proceedings. Investigations of fraud and mismanagement, employee misconduct, and civil rights violations may fall into this category. In certain cases, we may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records that relate to violations in order not to disclose that an investigation is in progress or may be conducted.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Fair trial or impartial adjudication.</E> We may withhold records when release would deprive a person of a fair trial or an impartial adjudication because of prejudicial publicity.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Personal privacy.</E> We are careful not to disclose information that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. When a name surfaces in an investigation, that person is likely to <PRTPAGE P="128"/>be vulnerable to innuendo, rumor, harassment, or retaliation.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Confidential sources and information.</E> We may withhold records whose release could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source of information. A confidential source may be an individual; a state, local, or foreign Government agency; or any private organization. The exemption applies whether the source provides information under an express promise of confidentiality or under circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred. Also, where the record, or information in it, has been compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority conducting a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security investigation, the exemption also protects all information supplied by a confidential source. Also protected from mandatory disclosure is any information which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the system of confidentiality that assures a flow of information from sources to investigatory agencies.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Techniques and procedures.</E> We may withhold records reflecting special techniques or procedures of investigation or prosecution not otherwise generally known to the public. In some cases, it is not possible to describe even in general terms those techniques without disclosing the very material to be withheld. We may also withhold records whose release would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if this disclosure could reasonably be expected to create a risk that someone could circumvent requirements of law or of regulation.</P>
        <P>(6) <E T="03">Life and physical safety.</E> We may withhold records whose disclosure could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual. This protection extends to threats and harassment as well as to physical violence.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Exemptions eight and nine—records on financial institutions and records on wells.</E> (1) Exemption eight permits us to withhold records about regulation or supervision of financial institutions.</P>
        <P>(2) Exemption nine permits the withholding of geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</P>

        <P>It is the policy of the United States Information Agency that information about its operations, organization, procedures, and records be freely available to the public in accordance with the provisions of Pub. L. 89-487, the “Public Information Act of 1966”, referred to hereinafter as “The Act”, which amended the “Public Information” section of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 552).</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 504.2</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Description of central and field organization, established places at which, officers from whom, and methods whereby the public may obtain information.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) The United States Information Agency, redesignated by section 303(a) of the United States Information Agency Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1982 and 1983 (Pub. L. 97-241, Stat. 291), was formerly the International Communication Agency.</P>

        <P>(b) The United States International Communication Agency was established as an independent Agency of the Executive Branch of the Government by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977. The Director of the Agency is responsible for reporting to the President and the Secretary of State, as well as advising the National Security Council, on international informational, educational, and cultural matters. The <PRTPAGE P="129"/>scope of the Director's advice includes assessments of the impact of actual and proposed U.S. foreign policy decisions on public opinion abroad.</P>
        <P>(c) Reorganization Plan No. 2 transferred to the new Agency overseas information functions previously lodged in the U.S. Information Agency and the educational and cultural affairs functions of the Department of State. The Reorganization Plan abolished the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information and the U.S. Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs and established the U.S. Advisory Commission on International Communication, Cultural, and Educational Affairs whose name was subsequently changed to the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy by section 604 of the Department of State Authorizaton Act, Fiscal Years 1980-1981 (93 Stat. 390, August 15, 1979).</P>
        <P>(d) The United States Information Agency has responsibility for the conduct of international information, educational, and cultural activities, including exchange programs to build bridges of mutual understanding between Americans and the other peoples of the world. The United States Information Agency engages in a wide variety of communication activities—from academic and cultural exchanges to press, radio, and television programs—to accomplish its goals of strengthening foreign understanding of American society and support of United States policies. The United States Information Agency operates field posts in 129 foreign countries.</P>
        <P>(e) Agency operations are organized along both functional and geographical lines and directed by the Executive Policy Committee composed of the Director, Deputy Director, Counselor, four Bureau Associate Directors, five Area Office Directors, the Inspector General, Director of Private Sector Committees, Coordinator of the President's U.S.-Soviet Exchange Initiative, the General Counsel and Congressional Liaison, Director of the Television and Film Service, Director of the Office of Public Liaison, and the Comptroller of the Agency.</P>
        <P>(1) The four Bureaus are: Voice of America (VOA), Programs (P), Educational and Cultural Affairs (E), and Management (M).</P>
        <P>(i) The Voice of America is the global radio network of the United States Information Agency which seeks to promote understanding abroad of the United States, its people, culture, and policies. In carrying out its mission, VOA is responsible for conducting its operations in accordance with the VOA Charter, (Pub. L. 94-350), which states:</P>
        <P>(A) VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive.</P>
        <P>(B) VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.</P>
        <P>(C) VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussion and opinion of these policies.</P>
        <P>VOA produces and broadcasts radio programs in English and 41 foreign languages, and has developed an integrated network of broadcasting and relay facilities in the United States and in different parts of the world to transmit these programs. The Voice of America's Radio Marti Program, established by Pub. L. 98-111, provides news commentary and other information about events in Cuba and elsewhere so as to promote the cause of freedom in Cuba. Radio Marti broadcasts in accordance with all Voice of America standards to ensure that its programs are objective, accurate, balanced and present a variety of views. The Voice of America reflects what is happening in the United States and the world. It informs, explains, and enlightens. The Voice of America provides background in which listeners can better understand the diversity of American society.</P>

        <P>(ii) The Bureau of Programs is comprised of three small specialized staffs, three foreign press centers, and four major offices and services, all reporting directly to the Associate Director. The Policy Guidance Staff provides <PRTPAGE P="130"/>both fast daily and in depth background guidance for operating elements of the Agency on those U.S. foreign policy issues which are susceptible to public diplomacy and on those domestic concerns which are relevant to the conduct of it. This staff also reviews program proposals of the Agency's overseas posts and Washington elements to assure that they are consistent with agreed-upon policy and that resources are allocated in accordance with priorities, and represents USIA in interagency meetings on public affairs issues, evaluates the extent to which media products reflect the Agency's subject priorities, and develops options and policy recomendations. The International Communication Policy Staff develops options and policy recommendations over the entire range of international communication policy issues for the Director of USIA and for the consideration of the U.S. Government as a whole. The Media Reaction Staff provides daily and special reports of foreign media reaction for the Director and 250 other policymakers in the White House, NSC, State, Defense and Treasury Departments, USIA, and other Federal agencies. Foreign Press Centers in Washington, New York, and Los Angeles provide facilitative services to foreign journalists working in those cities. The Office of Program Coordination and Development coordinates the design and implementation of all Agency support for major communication projects proposed by the Agency's overseas posts or undertaken by it in response to worldwide and regional priorities set by the Director, recruits American participants for those projects, and develops a systematic aggregation of essential resource materials to guide the acquisition and production of media support for them. This Office also is responsible for the development and coordination of the Agency's arts initiative undertaken through an agreement with the National Endowments, including recruitment and scheduling of all fine arts exhibitions and performing artists and groups for overseas programming. The Office of Research combines the functions of research on foreign public opinion and communication environment with analysis of long-term foreign media trends. The two media services, Exhibits, and Press and Publications, are responsible for the acquisition and production of a variety of media products for use or adaptation by USIA's overseas posts. These include exhibits in various formats, a daily wireless bulletin to all posts, magazines, pamphlets, reprints, photographs, and picture stories. The media services also operate printing plants at two overseas locations.</P>

        <P>(iii) Four major offices constitute the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. The Office of Cultural Centers and Resources provides policy direction, program support, and professional guidance and materials to USIA libraries, American and Binational Centers overseas; promotes the distribution of American books in English and in translation; operates a donated books program; and supports English teaching programs abroad. The Office of Private Sector Programs is responsible for developing cooperative projects with private sector institutions to support, complement and enhance the goals and objectives of the United States Information Agency. These projects are designed to promote a better understanding of the United States abroad by means of educational and cultural exchange between Americans and citizens of other nations. The Office of Private Sector Programs may provide selective assistance, encouragement, and grant support to nonprofit activities to U.S. organizations and institutions that satisfy this purpose, with special emphasis on international educational and cultural exchanges. The Office of International Visitors is responsible for planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating all International Visitor (both grantee and voluntary) programs; for managing the Agency's four reception centers; for serving as the Agency's liaison with public and private organizations involved in the International Visitor Program; and for arranging programs in the U.S. for UN Fellows and foreign government trainees. The Office of Academic Programs is responsible for organizing and assisting academic exchange between the United States and other countries; facilitating the establishment and maintenance of close ties between the <PRTPAGE P="131"/>American academic community and those abroad; encouraging and supporting learning; and providing staff support to the Board of Foreign Scholarships. The Office maintains liaison with a wide range of non-government institutions to encourage and support private exchange programs and foster institutional linkages across national boundaries; and coordinates international information, educational, cultural, and exchange programs conducted by other departments and agencies of the U.S. Government. The International Youth Exchange Staff is responsible for planning, developing and monitoring exchanges of young people in over 30 countries in all regions of the world. The International Youth Exchange Staff also administers a national campaign in the United States which encourages young Americans to go abroad, American families to host foreign students and local community involvement in youth exchange activities.</P>
        <P>(iv) The Bureau of Management is comprised of a management analysis staff and six major offices reporting to the Associate Director. These offices are responsible for planning, organizing, directing and controlling the Agency's administrative and management operations. These offices provide support services in the areas of administration, personnel and training, budget and fiscal operations, systems technology, security, equal employment opportunity, and contracts.</P>
        <P>(v) The Office of Public Liasion (PL), directs and carries out activities designed to discharge the Agency's obligation to provide information about USIA policies, mission and programs to the American people and the communications media. It publishes news releases, fact sheets and over pamphlets; provides Agency speakers in response to invitations from organizations and institutions in the U.S.; and holds seminars and workshops with academic, business, professional and public interest institutions and groups. It is responsible for the publication of the Agency's internal newsletter. The Office is responsible for conducting tours of the Agency exhibit at the VOA headquarters. The Office also maintains a public affairs staff at the Voice of America, which provides the media and public with information about USIA in general, with emphasis on the U.S. Government's broadcasting arm, the VOA. It also conducts daily tours of VOA facilities, arranges briefings for domestic and foreign groups and dignitaries, and facilitates media coverage of VOA activities.</P>
        <P>(vi) The Office of the General Counsel and Congressional Liaison (GC). The General Counsel and legal staff advise all elements of the Agency on the interpretation of all laws, regulations, and Executive Orders that authorize the Agency's programs or relate to the Agency's activities. The Office assists in the drafting of proposed legislation, Executive Orders, regulations, contracts, leases, and other legal documents, and participates in the negotiation of international agreements. The Office represents the Agency in hearings arising from disputes on contracts, equal employment opportunity, grievances, labor disputes, and licensing. The Office provides support to trial counsel in cases tried before domestic and foreign courts. The Office secures the necessary rights clearances for the Agency's activities, exercises in full authority vested in the Director by law relating to Exchange Visitor Program designation, visa waiver review, and authorized periods of duration of stays, and advises on matters relating to ethical conduct and conflict of interest of Agency employees. On congressional matters it maintains contact with Members and staffs and serves as Agency coordinator of hearings on substantive legislation and of Agency programming of Members and staff. The Office passes on all requests made under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.</P>

        <P>(vii) The Office of Inspector General conducts, supervises, and coordinates audits, program reviews and evaluations, and investigative inquiries relating to programs and operations of the Agency. In addition, the Inspector General directs the resources of the office to promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in the administration of the Agency's programs and operations. Further, the Inspector General keeps the Director fully and currently <PRTPAGE P="132"/>informed about how well such programs and operations are being administered, the problems and deficiencies existing in such programs and operations, and the necessity for and progress of corrective actions. The Inspector General also reports expeditiously to the Attorney General suspected violations of federal criminal laws and receives and considers for investigation employee (“whistleblower”) complaints. The Inspector General reports to and is under the general supervision of the Director or the Deputy Director.</P>
        <P>(viii) The Television and Film Service is responsible for planning, organizing and directing the Agency's television and film activities. The areas of responsibility encompass planning, and producing scheduled Worldnet television programming for satellite transmissions overseas; produces, acquires and maintains video tape libraries for overseas programming support; facilitative assistance to visiting foreign television and film producers; assistance to foreign broadcasters in the production and foreign telecast of cooperative television programs; and coordination with other U.S. and foreign government agencies on the dissemination of information overseas through television, video cassette libraries and motion pictures.</P>
        <P>(ix) The heads of the five geographic areas are the Agency's principal advisers on all programs within countries in their respective areas. They help to formulate Agency policies and represent the Director in interagency working groups. The Area Directors (Africa; Europe; East Asia and Pacific; American Republics; and North Africa, Near East, and South Asia) are responsible for the coordination and management of public diplomacy programs for the countries in their geographic areas. They supply a knowledge of the field programs and requirements to the Agency's policy and planning processes. They arrange with media services to provide media products to their areas. They consult with appropriate area and country officers in the Department of State and other foreign affairs agencies on operational matters of mutual concern.</P>
        <P>(x) The Agency maintains 213 posts abroad in 129 countries. These posts are under the supervision of the U.S. Chiefs of Mission, and with the guidance of the Director and the appropriate Area Office Director, conduct information, educational exchange and cultural programs on behalf of the U.S. Government. Each overseas office is headed by a Public Affairs Officer who is a member of the “Country Team” under the Chief of the U.S. Diplomatic Mission. A list of overseas offices is maintained by the Management Plans and Analysis Staff, Washington, DC 20547.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Procedures for requests.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) The agency will consider all written requests received from an individual for records pertaining to herself/himself as a request made under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) whether or not the individual specifically cites the Privacy Act when making the request.</P>
        <P>(b) All requests under the Privacy Act should be directed to the USIA, Office of the General Counsel, FOIA/Privacy Act Unit (GC/FOI), 301 4th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20547, which will coordinate the search of all systems of records specified in the request. Requests should state name, date of birth, and social security number.</P>
        <P>(c) Requests directed to the Agency's overseas posts which involve routine unclassified, administrative and personnel records available only at those posts may be released to the individual by the post if the post determines that such release is authorized by the Privacy Act. All other requests shall be submitted by the post to the Office of the General Counsel, FOIA/Privacy Act Unit (GC/FOI), 301 4th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20547, and the individual shall be so notified of this section in writing, when possible.</P>
        <P>(d) In those instances where an individual requests records pertaining to herself/himself, as well as records pertaining to another individual, group, or some other category of the Agency's records, only that portion of the request which pertains to records concerning the individual will be treated as a Privacy Act request. The remaining portions of such a request will be processed as a Freedom of Information Act request by the office noted in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 505.4</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Requirements and identification for making requests.</SUBJECT>

        <P>(a) Individuals seeking access to Agency records may present their written request or may mail their request to the USIA, Office of General Counsel, FOI/Privacy Act (GC/FOI) Unit, 301 4th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20547. The GC/FOI Unit may be visited between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday <PRTPAGE P="135"/>through Friday, except for legal holidays.</P>
        <P>(b) Individuals, seeking access to Agency records, will be requested to present some form of identification. Individuals should state their full name, date of birth and a social security number. An individual must also include her/his present mailing address and zip code, and if possible a telephone number.</P>
        <P>(c) When signing a statement confirming one's identity, individuals should understand that knowingly and willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another individual under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 505.5</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Disclosure of information.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) In order to locate the system of records that an individual believes may contain information about herself/himself, an individual should first obtain a copy of the Agency's Notice of Systems of Records. By identifying a particular record system and by furnishing all the identifying information requested by that record system, it will enable the Agency to more easily locate those records which pertain to the individual. At a minimum, any request should include the information specified in § 505.4(b) above.</P>
        <P>(b) In certain circumstances, it may be necessary for the Agency to request additional information from the individual to ensure that the retrieved record does, in fact, pertain to the individual.</P>
        <P>(c) All requests for information on whether or not the Agency's system(s) of records contain information about the individual will be acknowledged within ten working days of receipt of the request. The requested records will be provided as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P>(d) If the Agency determines that the substance of the requested record is exceptionally sensitive, the Agency will require the individual to furnish a signed, notarized statement that she/he is in fact the person named in the file before granting access to the records.</P>
        <P>(e) Original records will not be released from the custody of the records system manager. Copies will be furnished subject to and in accordance with fees established in § 505.11.</P>
        <P>(f) Denial of access to records:</P>
        <P>(1) The requirements of this section do not entitle an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
        <P>(2) Under the Privacy Act, the Agency is not required to permit access to records if the information is not retrievable by the individual's name or other personal identifier; those requests will be processed as Freedom of Information Act requests.</P>
        <P>(3) The Agency may deny an individual access to a record, or portion thereof, if following a review it is determined that the record or portion falls within a system of records that is exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and 552a(k). See §§ 505.13 and 505.14 for a listing of general and specific exemptions.</P>
        <P>(4) The decision to deny access to a record or a portion of the record is made by the Agency's Privacy Act Officer, Office of the General Counsel. The denial letter will advise the individual of her/his rights to appeal the denial (See § 505.9 on Access Appeal Committee's review).</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 505.6</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Medical records.</SUBJECT>
        <P>If, in the judgment of the Agency, the release of medical information directly to the requester could have an adverse effect on the requester, the Agency will arrange an acceptable alternative to granting access of such records to the requester. This normally involves the release of the information to a doctor named by the requester. However, this special procedure provision does not in any way limit the absolute right of the individual to receive a complete copy of her or his medical record.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 505.7</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Correction or amendment of record.</SUBJECT>

        <P>(a) An individual has the right to request that the Agency amend a record pertaining to her/him which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. At the time the Agency grants access to a record, it will furnish guidelines for requesting amendments to the record.<PRTPAGE P="136"/>
        </P>
        <P>(b) Requests for amendments to records must be in writing and mailed or delivered to the USIA Privacy Act Officer, Office of the General Counsel, 301 4th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20547, who will coordinate the review of the request to amend a record with the appropriate office(s). Such requests must contain, at a minimum, identifying information needed to locate the record, a brief description of the item or items of information to be amended, and the reason for the requested change. The requester should submit as much documentation, arguments or other data as seems warranted to support the request for amendment.</P>
        <P>(c) The Agency will review all requests for amendments to records within 10 working days of receipt of the request and either make the changes or inform the requester of its refusal to do so and the reasons therefore.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 505.8</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Agency review of requests for changes.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend or correct a file, the Agency shall incorporate the criteria of accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of the record in the review.</P>
        <P>(b) If the Agency agrees with an individual's request to amend a record, it shall:</P>
        <P>(1) Advise the individual in writing;</P>
        <P>(2) Correct the record accordingly;</P>
        <P>(3) And, to the extent that an accounting of disclosure was maintained, advise all previous recipients of the record of the corrections.</P>
        <P>(c) If the Agency disagrees with all or any portion of an individual's request to amend a record, it shall:</P>
        <P>(1) Advise the individual of the reasons for the determination;</P>
        <P>(2) Inform the individual of her/his right to further review (see § 505.9).</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 505.9</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Review of adverse agency determination.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) When the Agency determines to deny a request to amend a record, or portion of the record, the individual may request further review by the Agency's Access Appeal Committee. The written request for review should be mailed to the Chairperson, Access Appeal Committee, USIA, Office of Public Liaison, 301 4th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20547. The letter should include any documentation, information or statement which substantiates the request for review.</P>
        <P>(b) The Agency's Access Appeal Committee will review the Agency's initial denial to amend the record and the individual's documentation supporting amendment, within 30 working days. If additional time is required, the individual will be notified in writing of the reasons for the delay and the approximate date when the review is expected to be completed. Upon completion of the review, the Chairperson will notify the individual of the results.</P>
        <P>(c) If the Committee upholds the Agency's denial to amend the record, the Chairperson will advise the individual of:</P>
        <P>(1) The reasons for the Agency's refusal to amend the record;</P>
        <P>(2) Her/his right and the procedure to add to the file a concise statement supporting the individual's disagreement with the decision of the Agency;</P>
        <P>(3) Her/his right to seek judicial review of the Agency's refusal to amend the file.</P>
        <P>(d) When an individual files a statement disagreeing with the Agency's refusal to amend a record, the Agency will clearly annotate the record so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent to anyone who may subsequently have access to, use of, or reason to disclose the file. If information is disclosed regarding the area of dispute, the Agency will provide a copy of the individual's statement in the disclosure. Any statement which may be included by the Agency regarding the dispute will be limited to the reasons given to the individual for not amending the record. Copies of the Agency's statement shall be treated as part of the individual's record, but will not be subject to amendment by the individual under these regulations.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Disclosure of information.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) In order to locate the system of records that an individual believes may contain information about herself/himself, an individual should first obtain a copy of the Agency's Notice of Systems of Records as republished in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (Vol. 55, No. 151), on August 6, 1990. By identifying a particular record system and by furnishing all the identifying information requested by that record system, it will enable the Agency to locate those records which actually pertain to the individual. At a minimum, any request should include the information specified in § 505.4(b) above.</P>
                <P>(b) In certain circumstances, it may be necessary for the Agency to request additional information from the individual to ensure that the retrieved record does, in fact, pertain to the individual.</P>
                <P>(c) All requests for information on whether or not the Agency's system(s) of records contain information about the individual will be acknowledged within ten working days of receipt of the request. The requested records will be provided as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
                <P>(d) If the Agency determines that the substance of the requested record is exceptionally sensitive, the Agency will require the individual to furnish a signed, notarized statement that she/he is in fact the person named in the file before granting access to the records.</P>
                <P>(e) Original records will not be released from the custody of the records system manager. Copies will be furnished subject to and in accordance with fees established in § 505.11.</P>
                <P>(f) Denial of access to records:</P>
                <P>(1) The requirements of this section do not entitle an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
                <P>(2) The Agency is not required to permit access to records if the information is not retrievable by the individual's name or other personal identifier; those requests will be processed as Freedom of Information Act requests.</P>

See §§ 505.13 and 505.14 for a listing of general and specific exemptions.</P>
                <P>(4) The decision to deny access to a record or a portion of the record is made by the Agency's Privacy Act Officer. Officer of the General Counsel.

                <SUBJECT>Medical records.</SUBJECT>
                <P>If, in the judgment of the Agency, the release of medical information directly to the requester could have an adverse effect on the requester, the Agency will arrange an acceptable alternative to granting access of such records to the requester. This normally involves the release of the information to a doctor named by the requester. However, this special procedure provision does not in any way limit the absolute right of the individual to receive a complete copy of her or his medical record.</P>

The requester should submit as much documentation, arguments or other data as seems warranted to support the request for amendment.</P>
                <P>(C) The Agency will review all requests for amendments to records within 10 working days of receipt of the request and either make the changes or inform the requester of its refusal to do so and the reasons therefore.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Review of adverse agency determination.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When the Agency determines to deny a request to amend a record, or portion of the record, the individual may request further review by the Agency's Access Appeal Committee.

                <P>(b) The Agency's Access Appeal Committee will review the Agency's initial denial to amend the record and the individual's documentation supporting amendment, within 30 working days. If additional time is required, the individual will be notified in writing of the reasons for the delay and the approximate date when the review is expected to be complete. Upon completion of the review, the Chairperson will notify the individual of the results.</P>
                <P>(c) If the Committee upholds the Agency's denial to amend the record, the Chairperson will advise the individual of:</P>
                <P>(1) The reasons for the Agency's refusal to amend the record;</P>
                <P>(2) Her/his right and the procedure to add to the file a concise statement supporting the individual's disagreement with the decision of the Agency;</P>
                <P>(3) Her/his right to seek judicial review of the Agency's refusal to amend the file.</P>
                <P>(d) When an individual files a statement disagreeing with the Agency's refusal to amend a record, the Agency will clearly annotate the record so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent to anyone who may subsequently have access to, use of, or reason to disclose the file. If information is disclosed regarding the area of dispute, the Agency will provide a copy of the individual's statement in the disclosure. Any statement which may be included by the Agency regarding the dispute will be limited to the reasons given to the individual for not amending the record. Copies of the Agency's statement shall be treated as part of the individual's record, but will not be subject to amendment by the individual under these regulations.</P>

                <P>Many individuals in society possess great productive potential which goes unrealized because they cannot meet the requirements of a standard workweek. Permanent part-time employment also provides benefits to other individuals in a variety of ways, such as providing older individuals with a gradual transition into retirement, providing employment opportunities to handicapped individuals or others who require a reduced workweek, providing parents opportunities to balance family responsibilities with the need for additional income, providing employment opportunities for women returning to the workforce and assisting students who must finance their own education or vocational training. In view of this, the United States Information Agency will operate a part-time career employment program, consistent with the needs of its beneficiaries and its responsibilities.</P>

                <P>(a) Pursuant to the provisions of section 2401(b) of title 28 of the United States Code, a tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless presented in writing to the Agency within two (2) years after such claim accrues.</P>
                <P>(b) A suit may not be filed until the claim shall have been finally denied by the Agency. Failure of the Agency to make final disposition of the claim within six (6) months after it has been presented shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim for purposes of the Act and of this part.</P>
                <P>(c) A suit shall not be filed for a sum greater than the amount of the claim presented to the Agency, except where the increased amount is based upon newly discovered evidence not reasonably discoverable at the time for presenting the claim to the Agency, or upon allegation and proof of intervening facts, relating to amount of the claim.</P>

                <P>(b) In support of claims for damage to property which as been or can be economically repaired, the claimant should submit at least two itemized signed statements, or estimates by reliable, disinterested firms or itemized signed receipts if payment has been made.</P>
                <P>(c) In support of claims for loss or damage to property which is not economically repairable, the claimant should submit statements of the original cost of the property, date of purchase, and the value of the property before and after the accident together with a statement setting forth the basis used in arriving at such value. Such statements should be from at least two disinterested, competent persons, preferably reputable dealers or other qualified persons familiar with the type of property in question.</P>

                <P>The General Counsel will review the findings from the standpoint of questions of law applicable to the claim and will determine disposition. The General Counsel will make final review for settlement of the claim and will sign SF-1145, Voucher for Payment Under Federal Tort Claims Act, and forward it to the Financial Operations Division for payment of claim. Payment of any award or settlement in the amount of $2,500 or less will be authorized from the appropriation and allotment current for obligation on the date of settlement irrespective of when the cause of action arose.

                <P>If a claimant does not agree to a settlement of a claim of which is considered fair and equitable by the Agency's responsible officials, the claimant, upon the final disposition thereof by the Agency, may elect to file suit. Relief from claims which are disallowed may be sought by filing suit in the U.S. District Court for the district where <PRTPAGE P="148"/>the claimant resides or wherein the act of omission complained of occurred. The failure of the Agency to make final disposition of a claim within 6 months after it has been filed shall, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2672, and at the option of the claimant at any time thereafter, is deemed a final denial of the claim. If a suit is filed against the Government involving the Agency, the Department of Justice will request the Agency to furnish the complete file on the case. The Office of the General Counsel will represent the Agency in all negotiations with the Department of Justice.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Prior to initiating administrative offset, demand for payment will be made as follows:</P>

                  <P>(a) Written demands will be made promptly upon the debtor in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals will normally be made unless a response to the first or second demand indicates that further demand <PRTPAGE P="150"/>would be futile and the debtor's response does not require rebuttal. In determining the timing of demand letters, USIA will give due regard to the need to act promptly so that, as a general rule, debt referrals to the Department of Justice for litigation, where necessary, can be made within one year of the Agency's final determinatin of the fact and the amount of the debt. When necessary to protect the Goverment's interests (e.g., to prevent the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring) written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this chapter, including immediate referral for litigation.</P>
                  <P>(b) The initial demand letter will inform the debtor of: The basis for the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to request review within the Agency; the applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and administrative costs (Supart D of this regulation) and; the date by which payment is to be made, which normally will not be more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter was mailed or hand delivered. USIA will exercise care to insure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day that they are actually dated.</P>
                  <P>(c) As appropriate to the circumstances, USIA will include in the demand letters matters relating to alternative methods of payment, the debtor's rights to representation by his respective bargaining unit, policies relating to referral to collection agencies, the Agency's intentions relative to referral of the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation, and, depending on the statutory authority, the debtor's entitlement to consideration of waiver.</P>
                  <P>(d) USIA will respond promptly to communications from the debtor and will advise debtors who dispute the debt that they must furnish available evidence to support their contention.</P>

                <SECTION>
                  <SECTNO>§ 512.10</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Collection by administrative offset.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Collection by administrative offset will be undertaken in accordance with these regulations on all claims which are liquidated and certain in amount, in every instance where the appropriate Agency official determines such collection to be feasible and not otherwise prohibited.</P>
                  <P>(1) For purpose of this section, the term <E T="03">administrative offset</E> has the same meaning as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a)(1).</P>
                  <P>(2) Whether collection by administrative offset is feasible is a determination to be made by the Agency on a case-by-case basis, in the exercise of sound discretion. USIA will consider not only the practicalities of administrative offset, but whether such offset is best suited to protect and further all of the Government's interests. USIA will give consideration to the debtor's financial condition, and is not required to use offset in every instance where there is an available source of funds. USIA will also consider whether offset would tend to substantially disrupt or defeat the purpose of the program authorizing the payments against which offset is contemplated.</P>
                  <P>(b) Before the offset is made, a debtor shall be provided with the following: written notice of the nature and the amount of the debt and the Agency's intention to collect by offset; opportunity to inspect and copy Agency records pertaining to the debt; opportunity to obtain review within the Agency of the determination of indebtedness; and opportunity to enter into written agreement with the Agency to repay the debt. USIA may also make requests to other agencies holding funds payable to the debtor, and process requests for offset that are received from other agencies.</P>
                  <P>(1) USIA will exercise sound judgment in determining whether to accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. The determination will weigh the Government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the debtor.</P>
                  <P>(2) In cases where the procedural requirements specified in this paragraph (b) have previously been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt under some other statutory or regulatory authority, such as pursuant to an audit allowance, the Agency is not required to duplicate those requirements before taking administrative offset.</P>

                  <P>(3) USIA may not initiate administrative offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's <PRTPAGE P="151"/>right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect the debt. When the debt first accrued is to be determined according to existent law regarding the accrual of debts (e.g., 28 U.S.C. 2415).</P>
                  <P>(4) USIA is not authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716 to use administrative offset with respect to: Debts owed by any State or local Government; debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the tariff laws of the United States; or any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments which are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>
                  <P>(5) USIA may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by paragraph (b) of this section if failure to take offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt, and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later determined not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded 30 days after the Agency has notified the debtor in writing that the debt is not owed. Such written notification will be issued within 15 days after the Agency has confirmed through a review of its official records that the debt is not owed.</P>
                  <P>(c) Type of hearing or review: (1) For purposes of this section, whenever USIA is required to afford a hearing or review within the Agency, the Agency will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when: An applicable statute authorizes or requires the Agency to consider waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of veracity; or the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Agency determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary type hearing.</P>
                  <P>(2) This section does not require an oral hearing with respect to debt collection systems in which determinations of indebtedness or waiver rarely involve issues of veracity and the Agency has determined that the review of the written record is ordinarily enough to correct prior mistakes.</P>
                  <P>(3) In those cases where an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Agency will make its determination on the request for waiver or reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.</P>
                  <P>(d) Appropriate use will be made of the cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting collection by administrative offset. USIA will not refuse to initiate administrative offset to collect debts owed the United States, unless the requesting agency has not complied with the applicable provisions of these standards.</P>
                  <P>(e) Collection by offset against a judgment obtained against the United States shall be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.</P>
                  <P>(f) Whenever the creditor agency is not the agency which is responsible for making the payment against which offset is sought, the latter agency shall not initiate the requested offset until it has been provided by the creditor agency with an appropriate written certification that the debtor owes the debt (including the amount) and that full compliance with the provisions of this section has taken place.</P>

                  <P>(g) When collecting multiple debts by administrative offset, USIA will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying particular attention to the applicable statutes of limitations.<PRTPAGE P="152"/>

                  <SUBJECT>Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, USIA may request that monies that are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payments, or a minimal number of payment, debts owed the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials within the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.</P>
                  <P>(b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, USIA shall include written statements that:</P>
                  <P>(1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;</P>
                  <P>(2) The USIA has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and</P>
                  <P>(3) The USIA has complied with the requirements of § 512.10 of this part, including any required hearing or review.</P>
                  <P>(c) Once USIA decides to request offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it will make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.</P>
                  <P>(d) If USIA collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, USIA shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(e) This section does not require or authorize the Office of Personnel Management to review the merits of the USIA determination relative to the amount and validity of the debt, its determination on waiver under an applicable statute, or its determination whether to provide an oral hearing.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Collection in installments.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Whenever feasible, and except as required otherwise by law, debts owed to the United States, together with interest, penalties, and administrative costs as required by this regulation, should be collected in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being collected under administrative offset or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. If USIA agrees to accept payment in installments, it will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of the payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and ability to the debtor to pay. If possible the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within 3 years.</P>
                  <P>(b) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a voluntary installment plan is to be applied among those debts, the Agency will follow that designation. If no such designation is made, the Agency will apply payments to the various debts in accordance with the best interest of the United States as as determined by the facts and circumstances of each case, with particular attention to application statutes of limitation.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Format for request for recovery.</E> (1) Upon completion of the procedures prescribed under 5 CFR 550.1104 and its own regulations, the creditor agency shall certify the debt in writing to the paying agency.</P>
                  <P>(2) The creditor agency shall certify in writing that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt; the date on which payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect first accrued, and that the creditor agency's regulations implementing section 5514 have been approved by OPM.</P>
                  <P>(3) If collection must be made in installments, the creditor agency must advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencing date of the first installment.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Submitting the request for recovery.</E>—(1) <E T="03">Current employees.</E> The creditor agency shall submit the debt claim, agreement, or other instruction on the payment schedule to the employee's paying agency.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Separated employees.</E>—(i) <E T="03">Employees who are in the process of separating.</E> If the employee is in the process of separating, the creditor agency will submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in §§ 512.22 and 512.23. The paying agency shall certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor agency and the employee as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Where the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, it will send a copy of the certified debt claim to the agency responsible for making such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding. It is the responsibility of the creditor agency for pursuing the claim.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Employees who have already separated.</E> If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the creditor agency may request that monies which are due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801) or other similar funds be administratively offset in order to collect the debt (31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS).</P>
                  <P>(iii) <E T="03">Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another.</E> If an employee transfers to a position served by a different paying agency subsequent to the creditor agency's debt claim but <PRTPAGE P="157"/>before complete collection, the paying agency from which the employee separates shall certify the total of collection made on the debt. One copy of the certification will be supplied to the employee, and another to the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer. The original shall be inserted in the employees official personnel folder. The creditor agency shall submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can be resumed. The paying agency will then resume collection from the employee's current pay account, and notify the employee and the creditor agency of the resumption. The creditor agency will not need to repeat the due process procedure described by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>” Upon settlement or repayment of the debt all records of the debt will be removed from official personnel records.</P>
                  <P>(c) Processing the debt claim upon receipt by the paying agency:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Incomplete claims.</E> If the paying agency receives an improperly completed debt certification, it shall return the request with a notice that procedures under 5 CFR 550.1101 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and the creditor agency's own regulations must be completed and a properly completed debt certification form received before action will be taken to effect collection.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Complete claim.</E> If the paying agency receives a properly completed debt form, deductions will begin prospectively at the next officially established pay interval. A copy of the debt form will be given to the debtor along with notice of the date deductions will commence.</P>
                  <P>(3) The paying agency is not required or authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Assessment.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, or § 512.29, USIA shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. Before assessing these charges, USIA will mail or hand deliver a written notice to the debtor. This notice will include a statement of the Agency's requirements concerning §§ 512.9 and 512.21.</P>
                  <P>(b) Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor, using the most current address available to the Agency.</P>
                  <P>(c) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury Tax and Loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the Federal Register and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. The rate of interest as initially assessed shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. However, in cases where the debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks a new agreement, USIA may set a new rate which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the agreement is executed. Interest will not be assessed on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section.</P>
                  <P>(d) USIA shall assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt. Calculation of administrative costs shall be based upon actual costs incurred. Administrative costs include costs incurred to obtain credit reports in the case of employee debt or in using a private debt collector in the case of non-employee debt.</P>
                  <P>(e) USIA shall assess a penalty charge not to exceed 6% per year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.</P>
                  <P>(f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received shall be applied first to the outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest and third to outstanding principal.</P>

                  <P>(g) USIA will waive the collection of interest on the debt or any portion of <PRTPAGE P="158"/>the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. USIA may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by-case basis, if it reasonably determines such action is appropriate. USIA may also waive in whole or in part the collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs assessed under this section per the criteria specified in part 103 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 103) relating to the compromise of claims or if the Agency determines that collection of these charges is not in the best interest of the United States. Waiver under the first sentence of this paragraph is mandatory. Under the second and third sentences, it may be exercised under the following circumstances:</P>
                  <P>(1) Waiver of interest pending consideration of a request for reconsideration, administrative review, or waiver of the underlying debt under a permissive statute, and</P>
                  <P>(2) Waiver of interest where USIA has accepted an installment plan under § 512.12, there is no indication of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor and the amount of the interest is large enough, in relation to the size of the installments that the debtor can reasonably afford to pay, that the debt will never be repaid.</P>
                  <P>(h) Where a mandatory waiver or review statute applies, interest and related charges may not be assessed for those periods during which collection must be suspended under § 104.2(c)(1) of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 104).</P>

                  <P>(2) To debt arising under contracts which were executed prior to, and were in effect on October 25, 1982;</P>
                  <P>(3) To debts where an applicable statute, loan agreement, or contract either prohibits such charges or explicitly fixes the charges that apply to the debts arising under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff laws of the United States.</P>
                  <P>(b) However USIA is authorized to assess interest and related charges on debts which are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.</P>
                  <P>(b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under section 6 of the E.O. by:</P>
                  <P>(1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the governmentwide system;</P>
                  <P>(2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;</P>
                  <P>(3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of “ineligible” in § 513.105), and participants who have voluntarily excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;</P>
                  <P>(4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and</P>
                  <P>(5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.</P>
                  <P>(c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by—</P>
                  <P>(1) Providing for the inclusion in the <E T="03">List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs</E> all persons proposed for debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons determined to be ineligible; and</P>
                  <P>(2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.</P>
                  <P>(d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.</P>

                  <P>(a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of these regulations such transactions will be referred to as “covered transactions.”</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Covered transaction.</E> For purposes of these regulations, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Primary covered transaction.</E> Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lower tier covered transaction.</E> A lower tier covered transaction is:</P>
                  <P>(A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a primary covered transaction.</P>

                  <P>(B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary covered transaction.<PRTPAGE P="162"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Principal investigators.</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Providers of federally-required audit services.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The following transactions are not covered:</P>
                  <P>(i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;</P>
                  <P>(iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);</P>
                  <P>(iv) Federal employment;</P>
                  <P>(v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters;</P>
                  <P>(vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and</P>
                  <P>(vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations would be prohibited by law.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Relationship to other sections.</E> This section describes the types of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations will apply. Subpart B, “Effect of Action,” 513.200, “Debarment or suspension,” sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities described in 513.110(a). Sections 513.325, “Scope of debarment,” and 513.420, “Scope of suspension,” govern the extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a participant would be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Relationship to Federal procurement activities.</E> In accordance with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or suspension under the FAR.</P>

                  <P>(a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are appropriate means to implement this policy.</P>
                  <P>(b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in these regulations.</P>
                  <P>(c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.</P>

Such a request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but not limited to:</P>
                  <P>(1) Newly discovered material evidence;</P>
                  <P>(2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the debarment was based;</P>

State agencies that previously submitted a State agency certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central location for submission.</P>
                  <P>(3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those located in other State agencies.</P>

                  <P>(e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon as possible, but <PRTPAGE P="173"/>in any case by a date prior to the date on which performance is expected to be completed.</P>

Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.</P>
                  <P>(2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was convicted.</P>
                  <P>(i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.</P>
                  <P>(b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notices.

                  <P>2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person from participation in this transaction.</P>
                  <P>3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency determined to enter into this transaction.

                  <P>4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</P>

The terms <E T="03">covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded</E>, as used in this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.</P>

                  <P>6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment <PRTPAGE P="174"/>under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or agency entering into this transaction.</P>

                  <P>2. The certification set out below is a material representation of fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant.

                  <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>(a) The regulations set forth in this part implement the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (the “Act”), as amended, Public Law 87-256, 22 U.S.C. 2451, <E T="03">et seq</E>. (1988). The purpose of the Act is to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges. Educational and cultural exchanges assist the Agency in furthering the foreign policy objectives of the United States. These exchanges are defined by section 102 of the Act, 22 U.S.C. 2452, and section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J).</P>

                  <P>(b) The Director of the United States Information Agency facilitates activities specified in the Act, in part, by designating public and private entities to act as sponsors of the Exchange Visitor Program. Sponsors may act independently or with the assistance of third parties. The purpose of the Program is to provide foreign nationals with opportunities to participate in educational and cultural programs in the United States and return home to <PRTPAGE P="178"/>share their experiences, and to encourage Americans to participate in educational and cultural programs in other countries. Exchange visitors enter the United States on a J visa. The regulations set forth in this subpart are applicable to all sponsors.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Professors and research scholars.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> These regulations govern professors and research scholars, except:</P>
                  <P>(1) Alien physicians in graduate medical education or training, who are governed by regulations set forth at § 514.27; and</P>
                  <P>(2) Short-term scholars, who are governed by regulations set forth at § 514.21.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> A primary purpose of the Exchange Visitor Program is to foster the exchange of ideas between Americans and foreign nationals and to stimulate international collaborative teaching and research efforts. The exchange of professors and research scholars promotes interchange, mutual enrichment, and linkages between research and educational institutions in the United States and foreign countries. It does so by providing foreign professors and research scholars the opportunity to engage in research, teaching, and lecturing with their American colleagues, to participate actively in cross-cultural activities with Americans, and ultimately to share with their fellow citizens their experiences and increased knowledge about the United States and their substantive fields.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation.</E> The Agency may, in its sole discretion, designate <E T="03">bona fide</E> programs which offer foreign nationals the opportunity to engage in research, teaching, lecturing, observing, or consulting at research institutions, corporate research facilities, museums, libraries, post-secondary accredited educational institutions, or similar types of institutions in the United States.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Visitor eligibility.</E> An individual may be selected for participation in the Exchange Visitor Program as a professor or research scholar subject to the following conditions:</P>
                  <P>(i) The participant shall not be a candidate for tenure track position; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) The participant has not been physically present in the United States as a nonimmigrant pursuant to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J) for all or part of the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of program commencement set forth on his or her Form IAP-66, unless:</P>
                  <P>(A) The participant is transferring to the sponsor's program as provided in § 514.42; or</P>
                  <P>(B) The participant's presence in the United States was of less than six months duration; or</P>
                  <P>(C) The participant's presence in the United States was pursuant to a Short-term scholar exchange activity as authorized by § 514.21.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Insurance of Form IAP-66.</E> The Form IAP-66 shall be issued only after the professor or research scholar has been accepted by the institution(s) where he or she will participate in an exchange visitor program.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Location of the exchange.</E> Professors or research scholars shall conduct their exchange activity at the location(s) listed on the Form IAP-66, which could be either at the location of the exchange visitor sponsor or the site of a third party facilitating the exchange. An exchange visitor may also engage in activities at locations not listed on the Form IAP-66 if such activities constitute occasional lectures or consultations as permitted by § 514.20(g).</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Occasional lectures or consultations.</E> Professors and research scholars may participate in occasional lectures and short-term consultations, unless disallowed by the sponsor. Such lectures and consultations must be incidental to the exchange visitor's primary program activities. If wages or other remuneration are received by the exchange visitor for such activities, the exchange visitor must act as an independent contractor, as such term is defined in 8 CFR 274a.1(j), and the following criteria and procedures shall be satisfied:<PRTPAGE P="189"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> The occasional lectures or short-term consultations shall:</P>
                  <P>(i) Be directly related to the objectives of the exchange visitor's program;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Be incidental to the exchange visitor's primary program activities; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) Not delay the completion date of the visitor's program.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedures.</E>
                  </P>
                  <P>(i) To obtain authorization to engage in occasional lectures or short-term consultations involving wages or other remuneration, the exchange visitor shall present to the responsible officer:</P>
                  <P>(A) A letter from the offeror setting forth the terms and conditions of the offer to lecture or consult, including the duration, number of hours, field or subject, amount of compensation, and description of such activity; and</P>
                  <P>(B) A letter from his or her department head or supervisor recommending such activity and explaining how it would enhance the exchange visitor's program.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The responsible officer shall review the letters required in § 514.20(g)(2)(i) above and make a written determination whether such activity is warranted and satisfies the criteria set forth in § 514.20(g)(1).</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Category.</E> At the discretion of the responsible officer, professors may freely engage in research and research scholars may freely engage in teaching and lecturing, unless disallowed by the sponsor. Because these activities are so intertwined, such a change of activity will not be considered a change of category necessitating a formal approval by the responsible officer or approval by the Agency. Any Form IAP-66 issued to the exchange visitor should reflect the current category of the exchange visitor, either professor or research scholar.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Duration of participation.</E> The permitted duration of program participation for a professor or research scholar shall be as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">General limitation.</E> The professor and research scholar shall be authorized to participate in the Exchange Visitor Program for the length of time necessary to complete his or her program, which time shall not exceed three years.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptional circumstance.</E> The Agency may authorize a designated Exchange Visitor Program sponsor to conduct an exchange activity requiring a period of program duration in excess of three years. A sponsor seeking to conduct a discrete activity requiring more than the permitted three years of program duration, but less than six years of program duration, shall make written request to the Agency and secure written Agency approval. Such request shall include:</P>
                  <P>(i) A detailed explanation of the discrete exchange activity; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) A certification that the participation of selected research scholars will be financed directly by United States or foreign government funds.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Change of category.</E> A change between the categories of professor and research scholar shall not extend an exchange visitor's permitted period of participation beyond three years.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Extension of program.</E> Professors and research scholars may be authorized program extensions as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Responsible officer authorization.</E> A responsible officer may extend, in his or her discretion and for a period not to exceed six months, the three year period of program participation permitted under § 514.20(i). The responsible officer exercising his or her discretion shall do so only upon his or her affirmative determination that such extension is necessary in order to permit the research scholar or professor to complete a specific project or research activity.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Agency authorization.</E> The Agency may extend, upon request and in its sole discretion, the three year period of program participation permitted under § 514.20(i). A request for Agency authorization to extend the period of program participation for a professor or research scholar shall:</P>
                  <P>(i) Be submitted to the Agency, unless prevented by extraordinary circumstance, no less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the participant's permitted three year period of program participation; and</P>

                  <P>(ii) Present evidence, satisfactory to the Agency, that such request is justified due to exceptional or unusual circumstances and is necessary in order to permit the researcher or professor to <PRTPAGE P="190"/>complete a specific project or research activity.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Timeliness.</E> The Agency will not review a request for Agency authorization to extend the three year period of program participation permitted under § 514.20(i) unless timely filed; provided, however, that the Agency reserves the right to review a request that is not timely filed due to extraordinary circumstance.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Final decision.</E> The Agency anticipates it will respond to requests for Agency authorization to extend the three year period of program participation permitted under § 514.20(i) within 30 days of Agency receipt of such request and supporting documentation. Such response shall constitute the Agency's final decision.</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Exchange Visitor Program promotes the interchange of knowledge and skills among foreign and American scholars.

                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation.</E> The Agency may, in its sole discretion, designate <E T="03">bona fide</E> programs which offer foreign nationals the opportunity to engage in short-term visits for the purpose of lecturing, observing, consulting, training, or demonstrating special skills at research institutions, museums, libraries, post-secondary accredited educational institutions, or similar types of institutions.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Visitor eligibility.</E> A person participating in the Exchange Visitor Program under this section shall satisfy the definition of a short-term scholar as set forth in § 514.4.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Cross-cultural activities and orientation.</E> Due to the nature of such exchanges, sponsors of programs for short-term scholars shall be exempted from the requirements of providing cross-cultural activities and orientation as set forth in § 514.8(d) and § 514.10(c). However, sponsors are encouraged to provide such programs for short-term scholars whenever appropriate.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Trainees.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> These regulations govern all exchange visitor programs under which foreign nationals are provided with opportunities for receiving training in the United States. Regulations dealing with training opportunities which may, under certain conditions, be authorized for foreign students who are studying at post-secondary accredited educational institutions in the United States are found at § 514.23. Regulations governing medical trainees are found at § 514.27.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose of training.</E> The primary objectives of training are to enhance the exchange visitor's skills in his or her specialty or non-specialty occupation through participation in a structured training program and to improve the participant's knowledge of American techniques, methodologies, or expertise within the individual's field of endeavor. Such training programs are also designed to enable the exchange visitor trainee to understand better American culture and society and to <PRTPAGE P="191"/>enhance American knowledge of foreign cultures and skills by providing the opportunity for an open interchange of ideas between the exchange visitor trainees and their American counterparts. Use of the Exchange Visitor Program for ordinary employment or work purposes is strictly prohibited. For this reason the regulations in this section are designed to distinguish between receiving training, which is permitted, and gaining experience, which is not permitted unless as a component of a <E T="03">bona fide</E> training program.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of training programs.</E> (1) The Agency groups occupations into specialty, non-specialty, or unskilled occupational categories. The Agency will designate training programs in specialty and non-specialty occupations. Training programs in unskilled occupations or occupations in other categories which the Agency may from time to time identify by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> will not be designated. For purposes of these regulations, the Agency considers the occupations listed in Appendix E to part 514 to be “unskilled occupations.”</P>

                  <P>(2) For purposes of designation, the Agency will designate specialty and skilled non-specialty occupational training programs in any of the following occupational categories:

                  <P>(3) Sponsors may apply for designation for training programs in any combination of specialty and/or non-specialty occupations. Once designated, the sponsor may provide training in any occupation falling within the designated category, if not otherwise prohibited from doing so. Sponsors shall provide training to exchange visitors only in the category or categories for which they have obtained Agency designation.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Obligations of training program sponsors.</E> (1) Sponsors designated by the Agency to provide training to foreign exchange visitors shall:</P>

                  <P>(ii) Ensure that skills, knowledge, and competence are imparted to the trainee through a structured program of activities which are supportive and appropriate to the training experience. These may include, for example, classroom training, seminars, rotation through several departments, on-the-job training, and attendance at conferences, as appropriate.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Develop, prior to the start of training, a detailed training plan geared to defined objectives for each trainee or group of similarly-situated trainees.</P>

                  <P>(v) Ensure that sufficient plant, equipment, and trained personnel are available to provide the training specified.</P>
                  <P>(2) Sponsors designated by the Agency to provide training to foreign exchange visitors shall not:</P>

                  <P>(ii) Place trainees in positions which are filled or would be filled by full-time or part-time employees.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of third parties.</E> (1) The sponsor may utilize the services of third parties in the conduct of the designated training program. If a third party is utilized, the sponsor and the third party shall execute a written agreement which delineates the respective obligations and duties of the parties and specifically recites the third party's obligation to act in accordance with these regulations. The sponsor shall maintain a copy of such agreement in its files.</P>

                  <P>(2) The sponsor's use of a third party in the conduct of a designated training <PRTPAGE P="192"/>program does not relieve the sponsor of its obligation to comply, and to ensure the third party's compliance, with all applicable regulations. Any failure on the part of the third party to comply with all applicable regulations will be imputed to the sponsor.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Application for designation of training programs.</E> (1) An applicant for designation as an exchange visitor training program shall demonstrate to the Agency its ability to comply with both the General Provisions set forth in subpart A, and the obligations of training sponsors set forth in § 514.22(d).</P>

                  <P>(ii) If third parties are to be used to conduct one or more aspects of the activities for which designation is sought, the applicant shall provide the Agency with forms and procedures which will be used by the sponsor to ensure third party compliance with all applicable regulations and fulfillment of the goals and purposes of the sponsor's exchange visitor program.</P>
                  <P>(iii) If the applicant intends to utilize the services of third parties to conduct the training, a copy of an executed third-party agreement or, if one has not yet been executed, an illustrative copy of the type of agreement the applicant intends to execute with third parties shall be submitted with the application.</P>
                  <P>(3) If the training program is accredited in accordance with § 514.22(n), the applicant shall include a copy of the accreditation in its application.</P>
                  <P>(4) The application shall include a certification that:</P>
                  <P>(i) Sufficient physical plant, equipment, and trained personnel will be dedicated to provide the training specified;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The training program is not designed to recruit and train aliens for employment in the United States;</P>

Such exchanges enable visitors to understand better American culture, society, and teaching practices at the primary and secondary levels, and enhance American knowledge of foreign cultures, customs, and teaching approaches.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation</E>. The Agency may, in its discretion, designate <E T="03">bona fide</E> programs satisfying the objectives in section (a) above as exchange visitor programs in the teacher category.</P>

The objective is to develop and strengthen professional and personal ties between key foreign nationals and Americans and American institutions. The government visitor programs are for such persons as editors, business and professional persons, government officials, and labor leaders.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Camp counselors.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> In order to promote diverse opportunities for participation in educational and cultural exchange programs, the Agency designates exchange sponsors to facilitate the entry of foreign nationals to serve as counselors in U.S. summer camps. These programs promote international understanding by improving American knowledge of foreign cultures while enabling foreign participants to increase their knowledge of American culture. The foreign participants are best able to carry out this objective by serving as counselors per se, that is, having direct responsibility for supervision of groups of American youth and of activities that bring them into interaction with their charges. While it is recognized that some non-counseling chores are an essential part of camp life for all counselors, this program is not intended to assist American camps in bringing in foreign nationals to serve as administrative personnel, cooks, or menial laborers, such as dishwashers or janitors.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Participant eligibility.</E> Participation in camp counselor exchange programs is limited to foreign nationals who:</P>
                  <P>(1) Are at least 18 years of age;</P>
                  <P>(2) Are <E T="03">bona fide</E> youth workers, students, teachers, or individuals with specialized skills; and</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Participant selection.</E> In addition to satisfying the requirements in § 514.10(a), sponsors shall adequately screen all international candidates for camp counselor programs and at a minimum:</P>
                  <P>(1) Conduct an in-person interview; and</P>
                  <P>(2) Secure references from a participant's employer or teacher regarding his or her suitability for participation in a camp counselor exchange.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Participant orientation.</E> Sponsors shall provide participants, prior to their departure from the home country, detailed information regarding:</P>
                  <P>(1) Duties and responsibilities relating to their service as a camp counselor;</P>
                  <P>(2) Contractual obligations relating to their acceptance of a camp counselor position; and</P>
                  <P>(3) Financial compensation for their service as a camp counselor.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Participant placements.</E> Sponsors shall place eligible participants at camping facilities which are:</P>
                  <P>(1) Accredited;</P>
                  <P>(2) A member in good standing of the American Camping Association;</P>
                  <P>(3) Officially affiliated with a nationally recognized non-profit organization; or</P>
                  <P>(4) Have been inspected, evaluated, and approved by the sponsor.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Participant compensation.</E> Sponsors shall ensure that international participants receive pay and benefits commensurate with those offered to their American counterparts.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Participant supervision.</E> Sponsors shall provide all participants with a phone number which allows 24 hour immediate contact with the sponsor.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Program administration.</E> Sponsors shall:</P>

                  <P>(1) Comply with all provisions set forth in subpart A of this part;<PRTPAGE P="205"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(2) Not facilitate the entry of any participant for a program of more than four months duration; and</P>
                  <P>(3) Under no circumstance facilitate the entry into the United States of a participant for whom a camp placement has not been pre-arranged.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Placement report.</E> In lieu of listing the name and address of the camp facility at which the participant is placed on Form IAP-66, sponsors shall submit to the Agency, no later than July 1st of each year, a report of all participant placements. Such report shall reflect the participant's name, camp placement, and the number of times the participant has previously participated in a camp counselor exchange.</P>
                  <P>(j) In order to ensure that as many different individuals as possible are recruited for participation in camp counselor programs, sponsors shall limit the number of participants who have previously participated more than once in any camp counselor exchange to not more than ten percent of the total number of participants that the sponsor placed in the immediately preceding year.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory basis for rule.</E> Section 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, provides in substance as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) No person admitted under Section 101(a) (15)(J) or acquiring such status after admission:</P>

                  <P>(i) Whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the United States Government or by the government of the country of <PRTPAGE P="209"/>his nationality or of his last legal permanent residence;</P>

                  <P>(ii) Who at the time of admission or acquisition of status under 101(a)(15)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the United States Information Agency, pursuant to regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the services of persons engaged in the field of specialized knowledge or skill in which the alien was engaged [See “Exchange Visitor Skills List”, 49 FR 24194, <E T="03">et seq.</E> (June 12, 1984) as amended]; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) Who came to the United States or acquired such status in order to receive graduate medical education or training, shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until is established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last legal permanent residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States.</P>
                  <P>(2) Upon the favorable recommendation of the Director of the United States Information Agency, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or in the case of an alien who is a graduate of a medical school pursuing a program in graduate medical education or training, pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), or of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization after the latter has determined that departure from the United States would impose exceptional hardship upon the alien's spouse or child (if such spouse or child is a citizen of the United States or a legal permanent alien), or that the alien cannot return to the country of his nationality or last legal permanent residence because he would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attorney General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver requested by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(k) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184).</P>
                  <P>(3) Except in the case of an alien who is a graduate of a medical school pursuing a program in graduate medical education or training, the Attorney General, upon the favorable recommendation of the Director of the United States Information Agency, may also waive such two-year foreign residency requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last legal permanent residence has furnished the Director of the United States Information Agency a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an alien who is a graduate of a medical school pursuing a program in medical education or training may obtain a waiver of such two-year foreign residence requirements if said alien meets the requirements of section 214(k) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184) and paragraphs (a) (2) and (e) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for waiver on the basis of exceptional hardship or probable persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion.</E> (1) An exchange visitor who seeks a waiver of the two-year home-country physical presence requirement on the grounds that such requirement would impose exceptional hardship upon the exchange visitor's spouse or child (if such spouse or child is a citizen of the United States or a legal permanent resident alien), or on the grounds that such requirement would subject the exchange visitor to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, shall submit the application for waiver (INS Form I-612) to the District Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service having administrative jurisdiction over the exchange visitor's place of temporary residence in the United States, or, if the exchange visitor has already departed the United States, to the district Office having administrative jurisdiction over the exchange visitor's last legal place of residence in the United States.<PRTPAGE P="210"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(2)(i) If the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“Commissioner”) determines that compliance with the two-year home-country physical presence requirement would impose exceptional hardship upon the spouse or child of the exchange visitor, or would subject the exchange visitor to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, the Commissioner shall transmit a copy of his determination together with a summary of the details of the expected hardship or persecution, to the Waiver Review Branch, office of Exchange Visitor Program Services, in the Agency's Office of General Counsel.</P>

                  <P>(ii) With respect to those cases in which the Commissioner has determined that compliance with the two-year home-country physical presence requirement would impose exceptional hardship upon the spouse or child of the exchange visitor, the Waiver Review Branch shall review the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case, make a recommendation, and forward it to the Commissioner. If it deems it appropriate, the Agency may request the views of each of the exchange visitors’ sponsors concerning the waiver application. Except as set forth in § 514.44(f)(4), <E T="03">infra</E>, the recommendation of the Waiver Review Branch shall constitute the recommendation of the Agency.</P>

                  <P>(iii) With respect to those cases in which the Commissioner has determined that compliance with the two-year home-country physical presence requirement would subject the exchange visitor to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, the Waiver Review Branch shall review the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case, and after consulting thereon with the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs of the United States Department of State, make a recommendation, and forward such recommendation to the Commissioner. Except as set forth in § 514.44(f)(4), <E T="03">infra</E>, the recommendation of the Waiver Review Branch shall constitute the recommendation of the Agency and such recommendation shall be forwarded to the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for waiver made by an interested United States Government agency</E>. If an exchange visitor is a participant in an exchange visitor program or activity sponsored by or of interest to an agency of the United States Government, said agency may apply to the Waiver Review Branch for a waiver of the two-year home-country physical presence requirement on the ground that the granting of the waiver would be in the public interest and the exchange visitor's compliance with said requirement would be detrimental to a program or activity of interest to that agency. The application shall identify by name or location the organization which will utilize the exchange visitor's services and the name and address of the exchange visitor in the United States. The Waiver Review Branch shall review the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case and forward its recommendation to the Commissioner. Except as set forth in § 514.44(f)(4), <E T="03">infra</E>, the recommendation of the Waiver Review Branch shall constitute the recommendation of the Agency.</P>

The statement of no objection shall be directed to the Director through diplomatic channels; i.e., from the country's Foreign Office to the Agency through the U.S. Mission in the foreign country concerned, or through the foreign country's head of mission or duly appointed designee in the United States to the Director in the form of a diplomatic note. This note shall include applicant's full name, date and place of birth, and present address. Upon receipt of the no objection statement, the Waiver Review Branch shall instruct the applicant to complete a data sheet and to provide all Forms IAP-66 and the data sheet to the Waiver Review Branch. If deemed appropriate, the Agency may request the views of each of the exchange visitor's <PRTPAGE P="211"/>sponsors concerning the waiver application.</P>

                  <P>(2) The Waiver Review Branch shall review the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case and forward its recommendation to the Commissioner. Except as set forth in § 514.44(f)(4), <E T="03">infra</E>, the recommendation of the Waiver Review Branch shall constitute the recommendation of the Agency.</P>
                  <P>(3) An exchange visitor who is a graduate of a foreign medical school and who is pursuing a program in graduate medical education or training in the United States is prohibited under section 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act from applying for a waiver solely on the basis of no objection from his or her country of nationality or last legal permanent residence. However, an alien who is a graduate of a medical school pursuing a program in medical education or training may obtain a waiver of such two-year foreign residence requirements if said alien meets the requirements of section 214(k) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184) and paragraphs (a) (2) and (e) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(2) With respect to such waiver under Public Law 103-416, if such alien is contractually obligated to return to his or her home country upon completion of the graduate medical education or training, the Director of the United States Information Agency is to be furnished with a statement in writing that the country to which such alien is required to return has no objection to such waiver. The no objection statement shall be furnished to the Director in the manner and form set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and, additionally, shall bear a notation that it is being furnished pursuant to Public Law 103-416.</P>

The term of the employment contract shall be at least three years and the geographical areas of employment shall only be in areas, within the respective state, designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals;</P>

For purposes of this paragraph, the geographic area or areas must be designated by the Department of Health and Human Services as a Health Professional Shortage Area (“HPSA”) or as a Medically Underserved Area/Medically Underserved Population (“MUA/MUP”).<PRTPAGE P="212"/>
                  </P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Lesser sanctions.</E> (1) In order to ensure full compliance with the regulations in this part, the Agency, in its discretion and depending on the nature and seriousness of the violation, may impose any or all of the following sanctions (“lesser sanctions”) on a sponsor for any of the reasons set forth in § 514.50(a):</P>
                  <P>(i) A written reprimand to the sponsor, with a warning that repeated or persistent violations of the regulations in this Part may result in suspension or revocation of the sponsor's exchange visitor program designation, or other sanctions as set forth herein;</P>
                  <P>(ii) A declaration placing the exchange visitor sponsor on probation, for a period of time determined by the Agency in its discretion, signifying a pattern of serious willful or negligent violation of regulations such that further violations could lead to suspension or revocation;</P>
                  <P>(iii) A corrective action plan designed to cure the sponsor's violations; or</P>
                  <P>(iv) A limitation or reduction in the authorized number of exchange visitors in the sponsor's program or in the geographic area of the sponsor's recruitment or activity.</P>

                  <P>(2) Within ten days of service of the written notice to the sponsor imposing any of the sanctions set forth in this paragraph, the sponsor may submit to EVPS any statement or information, including, if appropriate, any documentary evidence or affidavits in opposition to or mitigation of the sanction, and may request a conference. Upon its review and consideration of such submission, the Agency may,in its discretion, modify, withdraw, or confirm such sanction. All materials submitted <PRTPAGE P="214"/>by the sponsor shall become a part of the sponsor's file with EVPS. The decision of EVPS is not appealable with regard to lesser sanctions in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) to (iv), if:</P>
                  <P>(i) The proposed limitation in the size of the sponsor's program is equivalent to 10 percent or less of the number of authorized visitors in the sponsor's program during the previous calendar year; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) The proposed limitation in the size of the sponsor's program will not cause a significant financial burden for the sponsor.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Suspension or significant program limitation.</E> (1) Upon a finding that a suspension, or a reduction in the sponsor's program equivalent to a number greater than 10 percent of the number of authorized visitors, is warranted for any of the reasons set forth at § 514.50(a), EVPS shall give written notice to the sponsor of the Agency's intent to impose the sanction, specifying therein the reasons for such sanction and the effective date thereof, which shall not be sooner than 30 days after the date of the letter of notification.</P>

In the event that the decision is to impose the sanction, such notice shall inform the sponsor of its right to appeal the sanction and of its right to a formal hearing thereon.</P>
                  <P>(4) The sponsor may within ten (10) days after receipt of the aforesaid notice effecting the sanction, appeal the sanction to the Exchange Visitor Program Designation, Suspension and Revocation Board (“Board”) by filing a notice of appeal with the Agency's General Counsel, room 700, 301 4th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20547.

All materials submitted by the sponsor shall become a part of the sponsor's file with EVPS. Within three (3) days of receipt of such submissions, EVPS shall notify the sponsor in writing of its decision whether to effect the suspension.

                  <P>(4) The sponsor may, within ten (10) days after receipt of the aforesaid notice continuing the suspension, appeal the suspension to the Board by filing a notice of appeal with the Agency's General Counsel, room 700, 301 4th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20547. The filing of the notice of appeal of a summary suspension shall not serve to stay the suspension pending appeal.</P>

Revocation need not be preceded by the imposition of a summary suspension, a suspension, or any lesser sanctions.</P>
                  <P>(2) Within ten (10) days of receipt of the aforesaid notice of intent to revoke, the sponsor shall have an opportunity to show cause as to why such revocation should not be imposed, and may submit to EVPS any statement of information, including, if appropriate, any documentary evidence or affidavits in opposition to or mitigation of the violations charged, and demonstrating that the sponsor is in compliance with all lawful requirements. All materials submitted by the sponsor shall become a part of the sponsor's file with EVPS.</P>
                  <P>(3) EVPS shall review and consider the sponsor's submission and, thereafter, notify the sponsor in writing of its decision on whether the revocation is to be effected. In the event that the decision on whether the revocation is to effect the revocation, such notice shall advise the sponsor of its right to appeal the revocation and of its right to a formal hearing thereon.</P>
                  <P>(4) The sponsor may, within twenty (20) days after receipt of the aforesaid notice effecting the revocation, appeal the revocation to the Board by filing a notice of appeal with the Agency's General Counsel, room 700, 301 4th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20547. The filing of the notice of appeal shall serve to stay the effective date of the revocation pending appeal.</P>

                  <P>(5) Upon receipt of the notice of appeal the General Counsel or his or her designee shall, within ten (10) days, convene the Board. Thereafter, proceedings before the Board shall follow the regulations set forth in § 514.50(i), <E T="03">infra.</E>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Voluntary termination.</E> A sponsor may voluntarily terminate its designation by notifying the Agency of such intent. The sponsor's designation shall terminate upon such notification. Such sponsor may reapply for designation.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Inactivity.</E> A sponsor's designation shall automatically terminate for inactivity if the sponsor fails to comply with the minimum size or duration requirements, as specified in § 514.8 (a) and (b), in any twelve month period.

Failure to apply for redesignation will result in the automatic termination of the sponsor's designation. If so terminated, the former sponsor may apply for a new designation, but the program activity will be suspended during the pendency of the application.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Summer Student Travel/Work Program.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) The following criteria apply to United States organizations which have been designated by the United States Information Agency (USIA) to administer Summer Student Travel/Work Programs. These programs are designed to achieve the educational objectives of international exchange by involving students during their summer vacations directly in the daily life of the host country through temporary employment opportunities. The criteria require program sponsors to promote the exchange of United States and foreign students on a reciprocal basis thereby assuring that the operation of such programs will not have an adverse impact on labor opportunities for United States youth in the 18-23 year age bracket.</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Selection.</E> The selection will be limited to bona fide university students screened for maturity and ability to get maximum benefit from Summer Travel/Work Programs. Priority consideration will be given to students who do not live in close proximity to the United States who would not be able to visit this country if temporary work permission were not authorized to help defray their travel expenses.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Orientation.</E> All students shall be provided with orientation, both pre-departure and upon arrival in the United States. The orientation should be designed to give the students a good basic knowledge of our country and its people. Students should be fully informed of the nature of the program in which they are participating. They should be provided with some type of identification card which includes the name and phone number of an official of the sponsoring organization as well as the number of the Exchange-Visitor Program in which they are participating. In addition, orientation should cover proper methods of obtaining and holding a job and the customary practices of giving employers adequate advance notice of resignation. Students should be fully briefed on the employment situation in the United States and advised not to seek employment in areas where a high unemployment situation exists.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Supervision.</E> Sponsors must be prepared to help their students at any time they have a medical, personal, employment, or other type of problem.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Jobs.</E> Each student sponsored on such a program must have a prearranged job before he or she comes to the United States, or firm appointments with prospective employers, or have sufficient personal funds so as to be financially independent if not employed.</P>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">United States employment.</E> Sponsors are required to check in advance with the Department of Labor to obtain information regarding areas or cities which have a high unemployment rate. Students should be advised to avoid such areas in seeking employment.</P>
                  <P>(6) <E T="03">Financial responsibility.</E> Sponsors are required to ensure that all participants return home at no charge to the United States Government.</P>
                  <P>(7) <E T="03">Health and accident insurance.</E> Sponsors shall ensure that every student has health and accident insurance coverage from the time of departure from home until the student returns to his or her home country. Minimum acceptable insurance is:</P>
                  <P>(i) Medical and accident coverage up to $2,000 per injury or illness; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Preparation and transportation of remains to home country (at least $2,000). Coverage may be provided in one of the following ways:</P>
                  <P>(A) By health and accident coverage arranged for by the student.</P>
                  <P>(B) By health and accident insurance coverage arranged for by the sponsor.</P>
                  <P>(8) <E T="03">Geographical distribution.</E> Sponsors shall develop plans to ensure that groups of students, especially those of the same nationality, are not “clustered” in certain areas or cities. Every effort should be made to have the students widely dispersed throughout the country.</P>
                  <P>(9) <E T="03">Arrival time.</E> Students for whom the sponsors have arranged “preplacement” for jobs can begin their programs at any time. Travel for students who have not been <PRTPAGE P="219"/>“preplaced” should be delayed by the sponsors as late as possible, preferably after June 15. Such delayed travel will give American students who are interested in obtaining summer jobs from two to four weeks in a less competitive market.</P>
                  <P>(10) <E T="03">Reciprocity.</E> Sponsors are required to administer Student Travel/Work Programs on a reciprocal basis. The number of foreign students a sponsor brings to the United States under this program shall not exceed, in any calendar year, the number of American students who were sent abroad by the sponsor on a Travel/Work Program. Should a sponsor fail in the realization of reciprocity in any given calendar year, the Agency may restrict the number of foreign students that the sponsor brings to the United States in the next calendar year to the number sent abroad by the sponsor in the preceding calendar year.</P>
                  <P>(11) <E T="03">Report requirement.</E> Sponsors are required to submit an annual report, not later than January 31, on the United States students who were sent abroad the previous calendar year under Travel/Work Programs. The report should contain the following information: Name and United States address of the student, the country where the student was employed, name of employer and type of business, and the type and length of employment (dates). The report should also include an ongoing evaluation of both the incoming program for foreign students and the outgoing program for American students. Major problems encountered in the administration of the program should also be listed. Failure to submit the report by January 31 will result in the automatic suspension of the program. The program will not be reactivated until the report is received by USIA and the sponsor notified that suspension has been lifted.</P>
                  <P>(12) <E T="03">Unauthorized activities.</E> Employment as servants, mother's helpers, au pair or other jobs of a domestic nature in private homes is not authorized. Employment must be of a commercial or industrial nature. Also, employment as a Camp Counselor is not authorized under the Travel/Work Program. All such unauthorized placements will be removed from the count of United States placements abroad which could reduce the number of foreign students which the sponsor will be permitted to bring into the United States during the following year.</P>

                  <P>(a) Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts. In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract).

A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, “substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.” Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.</P>

                    <P>(a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.</P>
                    <P>(b) Recipients’ financial management systems shall provide for the following.</P>

                    <P>(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in § 19.52. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These <PRTPAGE P="237"/>recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.</P>
                    <P>(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.</P>
                    <P>(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.</P>
                    <P>(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.</P>
                    <P>(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, “Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.”</P>
                    <P>(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.</P>
                    <P>(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.</P>
                    <P>(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.</P>
                    <P>(d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.</P>
                    <P>(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”</P>

                    <P>(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205.</P>
                    <P>(b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:</P>

                    <P>(2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.</P>
                    <P>(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient.</P>
                    <P>(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.</P>

                    <P>(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.<PRTPAGE P="238"/>
                    </P>
                    <P>(3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.</P>
                    <P>(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement,” or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.</P>
                    <P>(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.</P>
                    <P>(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.</P>
                    <P>(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds are not used.</P>
                    <P>(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.</P>
                    <P>(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.</P>
                    <P>(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless the conditions in paragraphs (h)(1) or (2) of this section apply.</P>
                    <P>(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements.</P>
                    <P>(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, “Managing Federal Credit Programs.” Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.</P>
                    <P>(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:</P>
                    <P>(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.</P>
                    <P>(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.</P>
                    <P>(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).</P>

                    <P>(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless the conditions <PRTPAGE P="239"/>in paragraphs (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.</P>
                    <P>(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.</P>
                    <P>(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.</P>
                    <P>(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.</P>
                    <P>(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. In keeping with Electric Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electric medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.</P>
                    <P>(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.</P>
                    <P>(1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.”</P>
                    <P>(2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs.

                    <P>(a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria.</P>
                    <P>(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.</P>
                    <P>(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.</P>
                    <P>(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.</P>
                    <P>(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.</P>
                    <P>(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.</P>
                    <P>(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.</P>
                    <P>(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.</P>

                    <P>(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.<PRTPAGE P="240"/>
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project.</P>
                    <P>(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.</P>
                    <P>(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.</P>
                    <P>(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.</P>
                    <P>(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if the conditions in paragraphs (g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.</P>
                    <P>(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.</P>
                    <P>(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges.</P>
                    <P>(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications.</P>
                    <P>(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.</P>
                    <P>(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.</P>
                    <P>(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.</P>
                    <P>(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.</P>
                    <P>(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties.</P>
                    <P>(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.</P>
                    <P>(ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.</P>

                    <P>(a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in this section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.</P>

                    <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall <PRTPAGE P="241"/>be retained by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of the ways listed in the following.</P>
                    <P>(1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.</P>
                    <P>(2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.</P>
                    <P>(3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs is based.</P>
                    <P>(c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
                    <P>(d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in § 518.14.</P>
                    <P>(e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.</P>
                    <P>(f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.</P>
                    <P>(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See §§ 518.30 through 518.37).</P>
                    <P>(h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.</P>

                    <P>(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency requirements. It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.</P>
                    <P>(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.</P>
                    <P>(c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the following program or budget related reasons.</P>
                    <P>(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).</P>
                    <P>(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document.</P>
                    <P>(3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.</P>
                    <P>(4) The need for additional Federal funding.</P>
                    <P>(5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the Federal awarding agency.</P>

                    <P>(6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,” OMB Circular A-122, “Cost <PRTPAGE P="242"/>Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,” or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,” or 48 CFR part 31, “Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,” as applicable.</P>
                    <P>(7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.</P>
                    <P>(8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.</P>
                    <P>(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.</P>
                    <P>(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this part and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following:</P>
                    <P>(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).</P>
                    <P>(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances.</P>
                    <P>(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.</P>
                    <P>(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.</P>
                    <P>(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.</P>
                    <P>(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.</P>
                    <P>(4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies.</P>
                    <P>(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.</P>
                    <P>(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section, do not require prior approval.</P>
                    <P>(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions whether the conditions in paragraphs (h) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.</P>
                    <P>(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.</P>
                    <P>(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.</P>
                    <P>(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in § 518.27</P>
                    <P>(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.</P>

                    <P>(j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support <PRTPAGE P="243"/>for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.</P>
                    <P>(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award.</P>
                    <P>(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.</P>
                    <P>(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.</P>

                    <P>For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.” The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.” The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.” The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.” The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.</P>

                    <P>Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.</P>
                    <P>(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Federal awarding agencies.</P>
                    <P>(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more of the following disposition instructions.</P>
                    <P>(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.</P>
                    <P>(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</P>
                    <P>(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.</P>

                    <P>(a) Federally-owned property. (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.</P>

                    <P>(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. <PRTPAGE P="245"/>12821, “Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.”) Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(b) Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is “exempt property.” Should a Federal awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.</P>

                    <P>(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.</P>
                    <P>(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.</P>
                    <P>(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.</P>
                    <P>(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.</P>
                    <P>(i) A description of the equipment.</P>
                    <P>(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.</P>
                    <P>(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.</P>
                    <P>(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.</P>
                    <P>(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.</P>
                    <P>(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).</P>
                    <P>(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.</P>
                    <P>(viii) Unit acquisition cost.</P>

                    <P>(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.<PRTPAGE P="246"/>
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.</P>
                    <P>(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.</P>
                    <P>(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.</P>
                    <P>(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</P>
                    <P>(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.</P>
                    <P>(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.</P>
                    <P>(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</P>
                    <P>(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.</P>
                    <P>(4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.</P>
                    <P>(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.</P>

                    <P>(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding <PRTPAGE P="247"/>agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate.</P>
                    <P>(iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.</P>

If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either cases, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.</P>
                    <P>(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.</P>

                    <P>Sections 518.41 through 518.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding <PRTPAGE P="248"/>agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.</P>

                    <P>The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.</P>

No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.</P>

The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.</P>

                    <P>(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following:</P>
                    <P>(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.</P>
                    <P>(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.</P>

                    <P>(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms or functions to be performed or performance required, including the <PRTPAGE P="249"/>range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.</P>
                    <P>(iv) The specific features of “brand name or equal” descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.</P>

                    <P>(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.</P>
                    <P>(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipient to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.</P>
                    <P>(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.</P>

                    <P>(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.</P>
                    <P>(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.</P>
                    <P>(5) Use of services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.</P>
                    <P>(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” or “percentage of construction cost” methods of contracting shall not be used.</P>
                    <P>(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by the implementation of E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.”</P>
                    <P>(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.</P>
                    <P>(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.</P>
                    <P>(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.</P>
                    <P>(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a “brand name” product.</P>
                    <P>(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.</P>
                    <P>(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small purchase threshold.</P>

                    <P>The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.</P>
                    <P>(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.</P>
                    <P>(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement.

                    <P>(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.</P>
                    <P>(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.</P>
                    <P>(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.</P>
                    <P>(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.</P>
                    <P>(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”</P>

                    <P>(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the Comptroller General of the <PRTPAGE P="251"/>United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.</P>
                    <P>(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable.</P>

Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements.

                    <P>(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.</P>
                    <P>(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.</P>
                    <P>(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.</P>

                    <SUBJECT>Financial reporting.</SUBJECT>
                    <P>(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.</P>
                    <P>(1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report.</P>

                    <P>(i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at <PRTPAGE P="252"/>the completion of the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.</P>
                    <P>(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.</P>
                    <P>(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.</P>
                    <P>(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.</P>
                    <P>(2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.</P>
                    <P>(i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF-272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.</P>
                    <P>(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the “Remarks” section of the report.</P>
                    <P>(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the “Remarks” section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.</P>
                    <P>(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.</P>
                    <P>(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:</P>
                    <P>(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section;</P>
                    <P>(B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or,</P>
                    <P>(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.</P>
                    <P>(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.</P>
                    <P>(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the “Remarks” section of the reports.</P>
                    <P>(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in § 518.21, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.</P>
                    <P>(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.</P>
                    <P>(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.</P>

                    <P>(5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs <PRTPAGE P="253"/>to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy of reporting.</P>

                    <SUBJECT>Retention and access requirements for records.</SUBJECT>
                    <P>(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. Federal awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients.</P>
                    <P>(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only exceptions are the following.</P>
                    <P>(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.</P>
                    <P>(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.</P>
                    <P>(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.</P>
                    <P>(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. as specified in paragraph § 518.53(g).</P>
                    <P>(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.</P>
                    <P>(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.</P>
                    <P>(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).</P>
                    <P>(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.</P>

                    <P>(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records <PRTPAGE P="254"/>starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.</P>

                    <SUBJECT>Termination.</SUBJECT>
                    <P>(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.</P>
                    <P>(1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.</P>
                    <P>(2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.</P>
                    <P>(3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
                    <P>(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 518.71(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.</P>

                    <SECTNO>§ 518.62</SECTNO>
                    <SUBJECT>Enforcement.</SUBJECT>
                    <P>(a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in § 518.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
                    <P>(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                    <P>(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.</P>
                    <P>(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.</P>
                    <P>(4) Without further awards for the project or program.</P>
                    <P>(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.</P>
                    <P>(b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.</P>
                    <P>(c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if the conditions in paragraphs (c) (1) or (2) of this section apply.</P>
                    <P>(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.</P>
                    <P>(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.</P>

                    <P>(d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject <PRTPAGE P="255"/>to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing regulations (see § 518.13).</P>

                  <P>All contracts, awarded by a recipient including small purchases, shall contain the following provisions as applicable:</P>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Equal Employment Opportunity</E>—All contracts shall contain a provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246, “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by E.O. 11375, “Amending Executive Order 11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,” and as supplemented by regulations at 41 CFR part 60, “Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.”</P>

The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)</E>—When required by Federal program legislation, all construction contracts awarded by the recipients and subrecipients of more than $2,000 shall include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5, “Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts Governing Federally Financed and Assisted Construction”). Under this Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors shall be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The recipient shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of a contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333)</E>—Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of $2,000 for construction contracts and in excess of $2,500 for other contracts that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance with Sections 102 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under Section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 1<FR>1/2</FR> times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week.

                  <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 519.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
                  <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
                  <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>
                  <P>(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.</P>

                  <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 519.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

                  <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 519.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.<PRTPAGE P="262"/>

                  <P>(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.</P>
                  <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.</P>
                  <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
                  <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>

                  <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.<PRTPAGE P="263"/>

                <SUBJECT>Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the Director, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>
                <P>(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the Director in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:</P>
                <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;</P>
                <P>(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;</P>
                <P>(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;</P>
                <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;</P>
                <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;</P>
                <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
                <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
                <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
                <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
                <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>
                <P>(11) Where the misconduct of employees of agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;</P>
                <P>(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;</P>
                <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
                <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;</P>
                <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and</P>
                <P>(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.</P>
                <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the Director from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.</P>

Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 521.22(a).</P>
                <P>(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to</P>

To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.</P>
                <P>(f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of:</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Current index.</E> NED will maintain and make available on its premises for public inspection and copying a current index providing identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this section to be made available or published. NED will provide copies on request at a cost of $0.15 per page.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 526.5</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Availability of NED records.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Except with respect to the records made available under § 526.4, NED will, upon request that reasonably describes records in accordance with the requirements of this section, and subject to the exemptions listed in 5 U.S.C. 552(b), make such records promptly available to any person.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Requests for records—How made and addressed.</E> (1) Requesters seeking access to NED records under FOIA should direct all requests in writing to: Freedom of Information Act Officer, National Endowment for Democracy, 1156 15th Street, NW., Suite 304, Washington, DC 20005, (202) 293-9072.</P>
                <FP>Although requesters are encouraged to make their requests for access to NED records directly to NED, requests for access to NED records also may be submitted to USIA's Office of General Counsel and Congressional Liaison at the following address: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Coordinator, U.S. Information Agency, Room M-04, 301 Fourth Street SW., Washington, DC 20547.</FP>
                <P>(2) Appeals of denials of initial requests must be addressed to NED or USIA in the same manner, with the addition of the word “APPEAL” preceding the address on the envelope. Requests or appeals addressed directly to USIA's Office of the General Counsel and Congressional Liaison will not be deemed to have been received by NED for purposes of the time period set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(i) until actually received by NED. USIA shall forward any request or appeal received by it to NED within 2 working days from the actual day of receipt by USIA.</P>
                <P>(3) The request letter should contain all available data concerning the desired records, including a description of the material, dates, titles, authors, and other information that may help identify the records. The first paragraph of a request letter should state whether it is an initial request or an appeal.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative time limits.</E> (1) Within 10 working days after NED's receipt of any request for access to NED records in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, NED shall make an initial determination whether to provide the requested information and NED shall notify the requester in writing of its initial determination. In the event of an adverse determination, notification shall include the reasons for the adverse determination, the officials responsible for such determination, the right of the requester to appeal within NED, and that the final determination by NED to deny a request for records in whole or in part shall be submitted to the Director of USIA for review. NED shall also provide USIA a copy of its response as soon as practicable after it responds to the requester.</P>

                <P>(2) When a request for records has been denied in whole or in part, the requester may, within 30 days of the date <PRTPAGE P="287"/>of receipt by the requester of the adverse determination from NED, appeal the denial to the President of NED or his designee, who will make a determination whether to grant or deny such appeal within 20 working days of receipt thereof. All appeals should be addressed in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. If on appeal, the denial of the request for records is upheld, in whole or in part, NED shall notify the requester in writing of such determination, the reasons therefor, the officials responsible for such determination, the right of the requester to judicial review, and that the final determination by NED whether to deny a request for records in whole or in part shall be submitted to the Director of USIA for review.</P>
                <P>(3) If the requester elects not to appeal to the President of NED or his designee within the appeal period specified above, NED's initial determination will become the final NED determination upon expiration of said appeal period or receipt by NED of notice from the requester that he does not elect to appeal, whichever is earlier. If the requester chooses to appeal NED's initial determination within NED, the decision on appeal will become NED's final determination.</P>
                <P>(4)(i) Once NED's determination to deny a request in whole or in part becomes final, NED shall submit a report to the Director of USIA explaining the reasons for such denial no later than 5 working days thereafter.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Director of USIA shall review NED's final determination within 20 working days. If the Director of USIA or his designee approves NED's denial in whole or in part, USIA shall inform the requester and NED in writing of such determination, the reasons therefor, the officials responsible for such determination, and the right of the requester to judicial review of NED's determination. In the event of such a determination, USIA shall assume full responsibility, including financial responsibility, for defending NED in any litigation relating to such request.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the Director of USIA or his designee disapproves NED's denial in whole or in part, USIA shall promptly notify NED and thereafter NED shall promptly comply with the request for the pertinent records.</P>
                <P>(iv) Because review by the Director of USIA may resolve any dispute over access to NED records in the requester's favor, the requester is encouraged (but not required) to wait for the determination on review by the Director of USIA before seeking judicial review of NED's final determination.</P>
                <P>(5) In unusual circumstances as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), the time limit provisions noted in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section may be extended by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination can be expected. Such extensions of the time limits may not exceed 10 working days in the aggregate.</P>
                <P>(6) Any person making a request for records pursuant to § 526.5 may consider administrative remedies exhausted if NED fails to comply within the applicable time limit provisions of this section. When no determination can be dispatched within the applicable time limits set forth in this section, NED shall nevertheless continue to process the request. On the expiration of the time limit, NED shall inform the requester of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of the requester's right to treat the delay as a denial and of the requester's right to appeal. NED may ask the requester to forego appeal until a determination is made. A copy of any such notice of delay will be sent to the Director of USIA or to his designee no later than 2 working days after it has been sent to the requester. A court may retain jurisdiction and allow NED additional time to complete its review of the records, if it can be determined that exceptional circumstances exist and that NED is exercising due diligence in responding to the request.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions governing schedule of standard fees and fee waivers.</E> For purposes of these regulations governing fees and fee waivers:</P>
                <P>(1) All of the terms defined in FOIA apply;</P>
                <P>(2) A <E T="03">statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records</E> means any statute that <PRTPAGE P="288"/>specifically requires the NED to set the level of fees for particular types of records;</P>
                <P>(3) The term <E T="03">direct costs</E> means those expenditures that NED actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents, photographs, drawings or any other material to respond to a FOIA request. [Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16% of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, any heating or lighting, the facility in which the records are stored];</P>
                <P>(4) The term <E T="03">search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page by page or line by line identification of material within documents. Searches shall be conducted to ensure that they are undertaken in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both NED and the requester. “Search” is distinguished from “review” of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (<E T="03">see</E> subparagraph (c)(6) below);</P>
                <P>(5) The term <E T="03">duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a document, drawing, photograph, or any other material necessary to respond to a FOIA request. The copy provided by NED will be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters;</P>
                <P>(6) The term <E T="03">review</E> refers to the process of examining documents that are located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (<E T="03">see</E> subparagraph (c)(7) below) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, <E T="03">e.q.,</E> doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions;</P>
                <P>(7) The term <E T="03">‘commercial use’ requests</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, NED will determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Where NED has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, NED will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category;</P>
                <P>(8) The term <E T="03">educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, that operates a program or programs of scholarly study and/or research;</P>
                <P>(9) The term <E T="03">non-commercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (c)(7) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry;</P>
                <P>(10) The term <E T="03">representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. In the case of “free-lance” journalists, such journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization even though they are not actually employed by a news organization. A publication contract would be the clearest <PRTPAGE P="289"/>proof, but NED will also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees to be charged—general.</E> NED shall charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs it incurs. NED shall use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for documents, drawings, photographs, and any other materials made under the FOIA.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Specific fees.</E> The specific fees for which NED shall charge the requester when so required by the FOIA are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Manual searches for records—$8.00 per hour for clerical personnel; $15.00 per hour for supervisory personnel;</P>
                <P>(2) Computer searches for records—In any case where a computer search is possible and the most efficient means by which to conduct a search, NED will charge the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a FOIA request and the operator-programmer salary apportionable to the search. The charge for the cost of the operator-programmer time shall be based on the salary of the operator-programmer plus 16 percent;</P>

                <P>(3) Review of records—Requesters who seek documents for commercial use shall be charged for the time NED spends reviewing records to determine whether such records are exempt from mandatory disclosure. These charges shall be assessed only for the initial review; <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the review undertaken the first time NED analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. Neither NED nor the United States Information Agency will charge for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, NED will charge for review of records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply. The fee for review as that term is used in these regulations shall be $15.00 per hour;</P>
                <P>(4) Duplication of records—(i) making photocopies—15¢ per page; (ii) for copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts, NED shall charge the actual cost, including operator time, of production of the tape or printout; (iii) for other methods of reproduction or duplication, NED shall charge the actual direct costs of producing the document(s);</P>
                <P>(5) Other charges—(i) there shall be no fee for a signed statement of non-availability of a record; (ii) NED will not incur expenses arising out of sending records by special methods such as express mail;</P>
                <P>(6) Restrictions on assessing fees—With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, section (a)(4)(A)(iv) of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, requires NED to provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time without charge. NED shall not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. NED will not begin to assess fees until it has first provided the above-referenced free search and reproduction. The elements to be considered in determining the “cost of collecting a fee” are the administrative costs to NED of receiving and recording a requester's remittance and processing the fee for deposit in NED's account. For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the word “pages” refers to paper copies of a standard size, which will normally be 8<FR>1/2</FR> x 11 or 11 x 14. Thus, for example, requesters shall not be entitled to 100 microfiche or 100 computer disks without charge.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters: commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The fees to be charged each of these categories of requesters are as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) Commercial use requesters—when NED receives a request for documents for commercial use, it shall assess charges that recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Commercial use requesters are entitled to neither two hours of free <PRTPAGE P="290"/>search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. NED shall recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought;</P>
                <P>(2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters—NED shall provide documents to educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought;</P>
                <P>(3) Requesters who are representatives of the news media—NED shall provide documents to requesters who are representatives of the news media for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in subsection (c)(10) above, and the request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought;</P>
                <P>(4) All other requesters—NED shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the above categories those fees that recover the full reasonable direct costs of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Assessment and collection of fees.</E> (1) NED shall assess interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The fact that the fee has been received by NED, even if not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of the United States Code and will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
                <P>(2) Charges for unsuccessful searches—If NED estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees unless the requester has indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such notice shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. Dispatch of such a notice of request shall suspend the running of the period for response by NED until a reply is received from the requester.</P>
                <P>(3) Aggregating requests—Except for requests that are for a commercial use, NED shall not charge for the first two hours of search time or for the first 100 pages of reproduction. However, a requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When NED reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert are attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, NED shall aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. One element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period in which the requests have been made. Before aggregating requests from more than one requester, NED must have a concrete basis on which to conclude that the requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically to avoid payment of fees. In no case shall NED aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.</P>
                <P>(4) Advance payments—NED shall not require payment for fees before work has commenced or continued on a request unless:</P>

                <P>(i) NED estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00. In this event, NED shall notify the requester of the likely cost and may require an advance payment of an <PRTPAGE P="291"/>amount up to the full amount of estimated charges; or</P>
                <P>(ii) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged within 30 days of the date of billing.</P>
                <FP>In this event, NED shall require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above or demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before NED begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.</FP>
                <P>(iii) When NED acts under paragraphs (g)(4)(i) or (ii) above, the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA will begin only after NED has received fee payments described above.</P>
                <P>(5) Form of payment—Remittances shall be in the form of a personal check or bank draft drawn on any bank in the United States, a postal money order, or cash. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of: National Endowment for Democracy. NED will assume no responsibility for cash lost in the mail.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Fee waiver or reduction.</E> NED shall furnish documents without charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established by these regulations if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because the disclosure of the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In making a determination under this subsection, NED shall consider these factors in the following order:</P>
                <P>(1) Whether the subject of the request for documents concerns the operations or activities of the government. For purposes of determining whether this factor is met:</P>
                <P>(i) Records generated by a non-government entity are less likely to respond to a request for documents concerning the operations or activities of the government;</P>
                <P>(ii) Records that are sought for their intrinsic informational content apart from their informative value with respect to specific activities or operations of government are less likely to meet this factor.</P>
                <P>(2) Whether the information requested is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities. For purposes of determining whether the request meets this factor:</P>
                <P>(i) NED will consider the extent to which the information requested already exists in the public domain;</P>
                <P>(ii) NED will consider the extent to which the value of the information relates to an understanding of government operations or activities as opposed to the extent to which the information relates to other subjects.</P>
                <P>(3) Whether the information requested will contribute to public understanding of government operations or activities. For purposes of determining whether the request meets this factor:</P>
                <P>(i) NED will consider whether the disclosure will contribute to a public understanding as opposed to a primarily personal understanding of the requester;</P>
                <P>(ii) NED will consider the identity of the requester to determine whether such requester is in a position to contribute to public understanding through disclosure of the information. Requesters shall describe their qualifications to satisfy this consideration;</P>
                <P>(iii) NED will consider the expertise of the requester and the extent to which the expertise will enable the requester to extract, synthesize and convey the information to the public. Requesters shall describe their qualifications to satisfy this consideration;</P>
                <P>(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding will be significant. In determining whether this factor has been met:</P>
                <P>(i) NED will consider whether the public's understanding of the subject matter in question is likely to be enhanced by the disclosure of information by a significant extent;</P>
                <P>(ii) NED will compare the likely level of public understanding of the subject matter of the request before and after disclosure.</P>

                <P>(5) After NED is satisfied that factors (h)(1) through (4) have been met, it will consider whether the requested disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. <PRTPAGE P="292"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) For purposes of this subsection, <E T="03">commercial interest</E> is one that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest as those terms are commonly understood. Under this subsection, a “commercial interest” shall not be an interest served by a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester. All requesters who seek a fee waiver under section (h) of these regulations must disclose any and all commercial interests that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. NED shall use this information, information in its possession, reasonable inferences drawn from the requester's identity, and the circumstances surrounding the request to determine whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the disclosure. If information that NED obtains from a source other than the requester or reasonable inferences or other circumstances are used in making a determination under this paragraph (h)(5), NED shall inform the requester of the information, inferences or circumstances that were used in its initial determination. The requester may, prior to filing an appeal of the initial determination with the President of NED or his designee under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, provide further information to rebut such reasonable inferences, or to clarify the circumstances of the request to the person responsible for the initial determination. Such action by the requester must occur within 20 days of the initial determination by NED. Within 10 days of receipt of such further information, clarification, or rebuttal, NED shall respond to the additional information, reverse or affirm its original position and state the reasons for the reversal or affirmation. Receipt of an affirmation by the requester shall constitute an initial denial of a request for purposes of the appeal process described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) NED shall consider the magnitude of the requester's commercial interest. In making a determination under this factor, NED shall consider the role that the disclosed information plays with respect to the requester's commercial interests and the extent to which the disclosed information serves the range of commercial interests of the requester.</P>
                <P>(iii) NED shall weigh the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester against the public interest in disclosure in order to determine whether the disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. If the magnitude of the public interest in disclosure is greater than the magnitude of the requester's commercial interest, NED shall grant a full or partial fee waiver.</P>
                <P>(6) In determining whether to grant a full or partial fee waiver, NED shall, to the extent possible, identify the portion of the information sought by the requester that satisfies the standard governing fee waivers set forth in FOIA, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), and in paragraphs (h)(1) through (6) of this section, and grant a fee waiver with respect to those documents. Fees for reproduction of documents that do not satisfy these standards shall be assessed as provided in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section, a requester may appeal a determination of the fees to be charged or waived under these regulations as he or she would appeal an initial determination of documents to be disclosed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The National Endowment for Democracy (hereinafter “NED”) was created in 1983 to strengthen democratic values and institutions around the world through nongovernmental efforts. Incorporated in the District of Columbia and governed by a bipartisan Board of Directors, NED is tax-exempt, nonprofit, private corporation as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Through its worldwide grant program, NED seeks to enlist the energies and talents of private citizens and groups to work with partners abroad who wish to build for themselves a democratic future.</P>

                <P>(b) Since its establishment in 1983, NED has received an annual appropriation approved by the United States Congress as part of the United States Information Agency budget. Appropriations for NED are authorized in the National Endowment for Democracy Act (the “Act”), 22 U.S.C. 4411 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(c) The activities supported by NED are guided by the six purposes set forth in NED's Articles of Incorporation and the National Endowment for Democracy Act. These six purposes are:</P>
                <P>(1) To encourage free and democratic institutions throughout the world through private-sector initiatives, including activities which promote the individual rights and freedoms (including internationally recognized human rights) which are essential to the functioning of democratic institutions;</P>
                <P>(2) To facilitate exchanges between U.S. private sector groups (especially the two major American political parties, labor and business) and democratic groups abroad;</P>
                <P>(3) To promote U.S. nongovernmental participation (especially through the two major American political parties, labor, and business) in democratic training programs and democratic institution-building abroad;</P>
                <P>(4) To strengthen democratic electoral processes abroad through timely measures in cooperation with indigenous democratic forces;</P>
                <P>(5) To support the participation of the two major American political parties, labor, business, and other U.S. private-sector groups in fostering cooperation with those abroad dedicated to the cultural values, institutions, and organizations of democratic pluralism; and</P>
                <P>(6) To encourage the establishment and growth of democratic development in a manner consistent both with the broad concerns of United States national interests and with the specific requirements of the democratic groups in other countries which are aided by NED-supported programs.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Board of Directors.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) NED is governed by a bipartisan Board of Directors of not fewer than thirteen and not more than seventeen members reflecting the diversity of American society. The officers of the corporation are Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board, who shall be members of the Board, a President, Secretary and Treasurer, and such other officers as the Board of Directors may from time to time appoint. Meetings of the Board of Directors are held at times determined by the Board, but in no event fewer than four times each year. A current list of members of the Board of Directors and a schedule of upcoming meetings is available from NED's office at 1156 15th Street, NW., Suite 304, Washington, DC 20005.</P>

                <P>(b) All major policy and funding decisions are made by the Board of Directors. The primary statement of NED's operating philosophy, general principles and priorities is contained in the National Endowment for Democracy's <E T="03">Statement of Principles and Objectives,</E>
                  <PRTPAGE P="294"/>adopted by the Board of Directors in December 1984. Copies of this statement as well as other general information concerning the organization are available from NED on request.</P>
                <P>(c) As a grantmaking organization, NED does not carry out programs directly. The procedures for approval of grants are stated in NED's bylaws: “[a]ll grants made by the corporation shall be by a two-thirds vote of those voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present, provided, however, that no grant may be approved by less than a majority of the Board of Directors” (Article VI, Section 5). In addition, “[a]ny Board member who is an officer or director of an organization seeking to receive grants from the Corporation must abstain from consideration of and any vote on such grant” (Article VI, Section 6). Copies of the bylaws are available from NED's offices.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Management.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) NED's operations and staff are managed by a President selected by the Board of Directors. The President is the chief executive officer of the corporation and manages the business of the corporation under the policy direction of the Board of Directors. The President directs a staff whose functions are divided among the Office of the President, a Program Section and a Finance Office.</P>
                <P>(b) The Office of the President provides policy direction and is responsible for day-to-day management of the organization, including personnel management, liaison with the Board of Directors and preparation of meetings of the Board and Board committees. The President's office also provides information concerning NED's activities to the press and public. The Program Section, under the direction of the Director of Program, is responsible for the review and preparation of proposals submitted to the Endowment and for the monitoring and evaluation of all programs funded by NED.</P>
                <P>(c) The Finance Office, under the direction of the Comptroller, is responsible, with the President and the Board of Directors, for financial management of NED's affairs, including both administrative financial management and grant management. The Director of Program and the Comptroller report to the NED President.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Description of functions and procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In accordance with the <E T="03">Statement of Principles and Objectives,</E> NED is currently developing and funding programs in five substantive areas:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Pluralism.</E> NED encourages the development of strong, independent private-sector organizations, especially trade unions and business associations. It also supports cooperatives, civic and women's organizations, and youth groups, among other organizations. Programs in the areas of labor and business are carried out, respectively, through the Free Trade Union Institute and the Center for International Private Enterprise.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Democratic governance and political processes.</E> NED seeks to promote strong, stable political parties committed to the democratic process. It also supports programs in election administration and law, as well as programs that promote dialogue among different sectors of society and advance democratic solutions to national problems.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Education, culture and communications.</E> NED funds programs that nourish a strong democratic civic culture, including support for publications and other communications media and training programs for journalists; the production and dissemination of books and other materials to strengthen popular understanding and intellectual advocacy of democracy; and programs of democratic education.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Research.</E> A modest portion of NED's resources is reserved for research, including studies of particular regions or countries where NED has a special interest, and evaluations of previous or existing efforts to promote democracy.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">International cooperation.</E> NED seeks to encourage regional and international cooperation in promoting democracy, including programs that strengthen cohesion among democracies and enhance coordination among democratic forces.</P>

                <P>(b) As a grantmaking organization, NED has certain responsibilities that <PRTPAGE P="295"/>govern its relationship with all potential and actual grantees. Briefly, these are:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Setting program priorities</E> within the framework of the purposes outlined in NED's articles of incorporation and contained in the legislation, and guided by the general policy Statement of the Board of Directors;</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Reviewing and vetting proposals,</E> guided by the general guidelines and selection criteria adopted by the NED Board;</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Coordinating among all grantees</E> to avoid duplication and to assure maximum program effectiveness;</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Negotiating a grant agreement</E> which ensures a high standard of accountability on the part of each grantee;</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Financial and programmatic monitoring</E> following the approval and negotiation of a grant, and ongoing and/or follow-up evaluation of programs prior to any subsequent funding of either a particular grantee or a specific program. Grantees will also be expected to monitor projects, to provide regular reports to NED on the progress of programs, and to inform NED promptly of any significant problems that could affect the successful implementation of the project. NED grantees will also conduct their own evaluations of programs.</P>
                <P>(6) As a recipient of congressionally appropriated funds, NED has a special responsibility to:</P>
                <P>(i) Operate openly,</P>
                <P>(ii) Provide relevant information on programs and operations to the public, and</P>
                <P>(iii) Ensure that funds are spent wisely, efficiently, and in accordance with all relevant regulations.</P>
                <P>(c) Institutes representing business, labor, and the major political parties carry out programs which are central to NED's purposes. As a result of their unique relationship to NED, institute programs are an integral part of NED's priorities and the institutes themselves are “core” grantees. As such, the institutes, while subject to all the normal procedures governing NED's relationships with grantees, will be treated differently in the following respects:</P>
                <P>(1) The institutes will have the mandate to carry out programs funded by NED in their respective sectors of business, labor and political parties.</P>
                <P>(2) As an integral part of the process of budgeting and setting program priorities, the NED Board will target a certain amount of its annual resources for institute programs in their respective fields of activity.</P>
                <P>(3) Unlike its practice for the majority of its grantees, NED will fund significant administrative costs for each of the core grantees.</P>
                <P>(4) Institute staff will assume responsibility for program development and preparation of proposals for the Board in each field of activity for which it has a special mandate.</P>

                <P>(5) NED will expect its core grantees to perform their monitoring/evaluation function described in programmatic monitoring under <E T="03">Financial and programmatic monitoring</E> above in a manner that will minimize the need to devote NED resources for these purposes. (Individual copies of the Grants Policy are available from the NED office.)</P>
                <P>(6) As stated above, in awarding grants the Board is guided by established grant selection critieria. In addition to evaluating how a program fits within NED's overall priorities, the Board considers factors such as the urgency of a program, its relevance to specific needs and conditions in a particular country, and the democratic commitment and experience of the applicant. NED is especially interested in proposals that originate with indigenous democratic groups. It is also interested in nonpartisan programs seeking to strengthen democratic values among all sectors of the democratic political spectrum.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Selection criteria.</E> In determining the relative merit of a particular proposal NED considers whether the grant application:</P>
                <P>(1) Proposes a program that will make a concrete contribution to assisting foreign individuals or groups who are working for democratic ends and who need NED's assistance.</P>
                <P>(2) Proposes a program, project or activity which is consistent with current NED program priorities and contributes to overall program balance and effectiveness.</P>

                <P>(3) Proposes an activity that meets an especially urgent need. <PRTPAGE P="296"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) Does not overlap with what others are doing well.</P>
                <P>(5) Proposes a program that will encourage an intellectual climate which is favorable to the growth of democratic institutions.</P>
                <P>(6) Proposes a program that is not only culturally or intellectually appealing, but will affect the education and the awareness of minorities and/or the less privileged members of a society.</P>
                <P>(7) Originates from an organization within a particular country representing the group whose needs are to be addressed.</P>
                <P>(8) Appears to be well thought out, avoiding imprudent activities and possibilities for negative repercussions.</P>
                <P>(9) Takes into consideration not only what objectively could be significant to a certain society, but how the cultural traditions and values of that society will react to the project.</P>
                <P>(10) Incorporates an analysis of the problem of democracy in the area in question and the method by which the proposed program will have a constructive impact on the problem.</P>
                <P>(11) Proposes a program that will enhance our understanding of what really helps in aiding democracy.</P>
                <P>(12) Creatively enlists supports for foreign democratic organizations.</P>
                <P>(13) Encourages democratic solutions and peaceful resolution of conflict in situations otherwise fraught with violence.</P>
                <P>(14) Proposes a program, project or activity that is clearly relevant to NED program objectives and not better funded by other government or private organizations. (Proposing organizations will be be referred to other funding organizations where substantial overlap exists.)</P>
                <P>(15) Proposes a program or strategy that is appropriate to the circumstances in the country concerned.</P>
                <P>(16) Proposes a program that can be expected to have a multiplier effect, hence having an impact broader than that of the specific project itself; or establishes a model that could be readily replicated in other countries or institutions.</P>
                <P>(17) Proposes appropriate, qualified staff who have a demonstrated ability to administer programs capably so as to accomplish stated goals and objectives.</P>
                <P>(18) Proposes an appropriate ratio of administrative to program funds.</P>
                <P>(19) Is responsive to NED suggestions with regard to program revisions.</P>
                <P>(20) Proposes a realistic budget that is consistent with NED perceptions of project value and is performed within a stated and realistic time frame; and</P>
                <P>(21) Proposes a program that has, as one of its principal aspects, a major impact on the role of women and/or minorities.</P>
                <P>(e) The following guidelines also apply to all projects funded by NED.</P>
                <P>(1) The proposing organization must be able to show that it is a responsible, credible organization or group that has a serious and demonstrable commitment to democratic values. (Various factors may be considered in this regard: recognized democratic orientation; established professional reputation; proven ability to perform; existence of organization charter, board of directors, regular audits, etc.);</P>
                <P>(2) The proposing organization must be willing to comply with all provisions of the National Endowment for Democracy Act as well as all provisions of current and subsequent agreements between the USIA and NED;</P>
                <P>(3) The proposing organization must agree not to use grant funds for the purpose of educating, training, or informing United States audiences of any U.S. political party's policy or practice, or candidate for office. (This condition does not exclude making grants or expenditures for the purpose of educating, training or informing audiences of other countries on the institutions and values of democracy that may incidentally educate, train, or inform American participants);</P>
                <P>(4) The proposing organization must agree that no NED funds will be used for lobbying or propaganda that is directed at influencing public policy decisions of the government of the United States or of any state or locality thereof;</P>

                <P>(5) The proposing organization must agree that there shall be no expenditure of NED funds for the purpose of supporting physical violence by individuals, groups or governments; <PRTPAGE P="297"/>
                </P>
                <P>(6) The proposing organization may not employ any person engaged in intelligence activity on behalf of the United States government or any other government;</P>
                <P>(7) NED will not normally reimburse grantees for expenses incurred prior to the signing of a grant agreement with NED;</P>
                <P>(8) Each grant made by NED will be an independent action implying no future commitment on NED's part to a project or program;</P>
                <P>(9) NED may, from time to time, fund feasibility studies. Applications for grants in this category should include, but not be limited to, the following: Scope, method and objective of the study; Calendar; Proposed administration of the study; and Detailed budget. The funding of a feasibility study by NED does not imply support for any project growing out of the study. It does, however, imply interest by NED in the area under study and a willingness to entertain a project proposal growing out of the study; and</P>
                <P>(10) The proposing organization may not use NED funds to finance the campaigns of candidates for public office.</P>
                <P>(f) All proposals received by NED are reviewed by the staff in order to determine their congruence with NED's purposes as stated in the organization's Articles of Incorporation and the NED Act.</P>
                <P>(g) Grant applications must contain the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) A one-page summary of the proposed program;</P>
                <P>(2) Organizational background and biographical information on staff and directors in the U.S. and abroad;</P>
                <P>(3) A complete project description, including a statement of objectives, a project calendar, and a description of anticipated results;</P>
                <P>(4) A statement describing how the project relates to NED's purposes;</P>
                <P>(5) A description of the methods to be used to evaluate the project in relation to its objectives;</P>
                <P>(6) A detailed budget, including an explanation of any counterpart support anticipated by the applicant, whether monetary or in-kind, domestic or foreign; and</P>

                <P>(h) After an award determination has been made by the Board, NED enters into a grant agreement with the recipient. That agreement is made in accordance with NED policy, the terms of NED's grant agreement with USIA, and the terms of the Act, and the terms of NED's standard grant agreement as they apply to the specific project in question. The NED Board of Directors approved a revised Statement of General Procedures and Guidelines on September 12, 1986. The statement, outlined above, is available from the NED office.</P>

                <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 530.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
                <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
                <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 530.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods—</E>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 530.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 530.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
                <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
                <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by <PRTPAGE P="302"/>October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
                <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
                <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
                <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
                <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

                <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
                <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
                <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>

                <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>

                <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 530.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If <PRTPAGE P="303"/>an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Mission.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Through the Act, Congress and the President determined that the formulation and implementation of United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy in a manner which will promote the national security could best be insured by a central organization charged by statute with primary responsibility for this field.</P>
          <P>(b) Under the Act, the Agency is charged with providing the President, the Secretary of State, other officials of the executive branch, and the Congress with recommendations concerning United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy, and assessing the effect of these recommendations upon our foreign policies, our national security policies, and our economy.</P>
          <P>(c) The Agency also has the capacity for providing the essential scientific, economic, political, military, psychological, and technological information on which realistic arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy must be based, and has the authority, under the direction of the President and the Secretary of State, to carry out the following primary functions:</P>
          <P>(1) The preparation for and management of United States participation in international negotiations and implementation fora in the arms control and disarmament field.</P>
          <P>(2) When directed by the President, the preparation for, and management of, United States participation in international negotiations and implementation fora in the nonproliferation field.</P>
          <P>(3) The conduct, support, and coordination of research for arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy formulation.</P>
          <P>(4) The preparation for, operation of, or, as appropriate, direction of United States participation in such control systems as may become part of United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament activities.</P>
          <P>(5) The dissemination and coordination of public information concerning arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament.</P>

          <P>(d) The Agency works at the highest level of the United States Government and, under the direction of the Secretary of State, conducts United States participation in international arms control and disarmament negotiations. It does not normally hand down decisions or engage in regulatory activities affecting the general public, since its functions are principally in the advisory or diplomatic areas. Copies of publications resulting from the Agency's activities, such as its Annual Report, may be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government <PRTPAGE P="307"/>Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or requested directly from the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Office of Public Affairs, 320 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20451.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Agency structure.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Agency is headed by a Director, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, who is responsible for the executive direction of the Agency. The Director is assisted by a Deputy Director, also appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, who acts for, and exercises the powers of, the Director during the Director's absence or disability or during a vacancy in said office.</P>
          <P>(b) The Director of ACDA ranks with the Deputy Secretary of State and reports directly to the Secretary of State; the Deputy Director ranks with an Under Secretary of State. The Director of ACDA is the principal advisor to the Secretary of State, the National Security Council, and the President and other executive branch Government officials on matters relating to arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament. The Director has direct access to the President as necessary. In addition, the Director has the authority and independence to deal directly with the heads of other agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, on matters not falling within the jurisdiction of the Department of State.</P>
          <P>(c) The Director is supported by a personal staff that includes the Counselor, Chief of Staff, Special Assistant, and Personal Secretary. Other entities included within the Office of the Director are: the Executive Secretary and Adviser for Internal Affairs, the Advanced Projects Office, the Chief Science Advisor, the Office of Military Affairs, the Office of the Inspector General, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Officer.</P>
          <P>(d) The Agency has four Assistant Directors appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate who rank with Assistant Secretaries of State. Each of these Assistant Directors heads a bureau, and it is through the bureaus that the Agency's program responsibilities are primarily discharged. The four current bureaus are the Multilateral Affairs Bureau, the Strategic and Eurasian Affairs Bureau, the Nonproliferation and Regional Arms Control Bureau, and the Intelligence, Verification, and Information Management Bureau. Within the range of its program responsibilities, each bureau is responsible for generating policy proposals, and for working closely with other ACDA units and Government agencies. Other Agency units with staff or Agency-wide responsibilities are the Office of the Director, Office of the General Counsel, the Office of Congressional Affairs, the Office of Administration, the Office of Congressional Affairs, and the Office of Public Affairs.</P>

The Deputy Director also <PRTPAGE P="308"/>has direct responsibility, under the supervision of the Director, for the administrative management of the Agency, intelligence-related activities, security and the Special Compartmental Intelligence Facility, and performs such other duties and exercises such other powers as the Director may prescribe.</P>
          <P>(c) The Executive Secretary and Advisor for Internal Affairs (D/EX), on behalf of the Director, initiates and provides Agency liaison to the national security agencies, coordinates within ACDA and with other agencies to ensure appropriate ACDA representation of interagency deliberations and international summits, and the timely exchange of information. The Executive Secretary advises the Director and other Agency Principals on arms control and administrative policy options, the status of policy deliberations within the Agency, and the optimum methods and procedures to implement policy decisions. The Executive Secretary maintains the Director's formal record of communications regarding arms control policy deliberations and decisions.</P>
          <P>(d) The Advanced Projects Office (D/AP) is ACDA's center for innovative concepts of arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament. It conceives and develops new avenues to aspects of arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament. Its projects build both on internally generated concepts and on ideas collected from government, academic, and non-governmental sources.</P>

The Senior Military Advisor evaluates arms control and nonproliferation proposals from a military perspective, and assesses their potential contributions to the national security of the United States.</P>
          <P>(g) The Office of the Inspector General is headed by the Inspector General of the Agency who has the duties, responsibilities, and authorities specified in the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (5 U.S.C. app.). The Inspector General of the Agency utilizes personnel of the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State in performing the duties of Inspector General of the Agency.</P>
          <P>(h) The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Officer has the primary responsibility for advising the Director of the Agency with respect to the preparation of the Agency's equal employment opportunity plans, procedures, regulations, reports, and other matters pertaining to the Agency's equal employment opportunity program, for evaluating the sufficiency of the total Agency program for equal employment opportunity, and when authorized by the Director of the Agency, for making changes in programs and procedures designed to eliminate discriminatory practices and to improve the Agency's program for equal employment opportunity. The EEO Officer maintains contact with the Office of Personnel Management, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, schools, and other related organizations.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Multilateral Affairs Bureau (MA).</SUBJECT>

          <P>MA develops and implements policy, strategy, and tactics for issues under negotiation and discussion in multilateral arms control fora. It provides organizational support and staffing for U.S. delegations to the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva, in which the negotiations on a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons testing (CTB) and on other issues related to nuclear weapons (e.g., fissile material cut-off) and conventional arms (e.g., transparency in armaments) are conducted, as well as for the First Committee of the UN General Assembly and the United Nations Disarmament Commission. The Bureau leads the U.S. effort to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) through the CWC <PRTPAGE P="309"/>Preparatory Commission in The Hague, and will potentially serve as the U.S. Office of National Authority (ONA) upon entry into force of the CWC. In addition, the MA Bureau takes the leading policy role in formulating Agency positions in support of the implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) through the Joint Consultative Group (JCG), the Treaty on Open Skies through the Open Skies Consultative Commission (OSCC), and the CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation (FSC), all in Vienna. The Bureau is also responsible for development and implementation of policy within the U.S. relating to other international arms control agreements and negotiations, including the international effort to strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) by enhancing transparency and confidence in compliance, and other related diplomatic activities, such as the BW Trilateral dialogue between the U.S., UK and Russia. MA takes the Agency lead in supporting other international efforts such as the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) for Iraq and peacekeeping initiatives. It also leads U.S. Government efforts, both substantively and administratively, for multilateral treaty review conferences, with the exception of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Bureau assists in the formulation of Agency policy with regard to arms control in regions of the world outside Europe.</P>

          <P>SEA has principal responsibility within the Agency for the diplomatic, political, and technical aspects of negotiations and implementation of strategic and nuclear arms control agreements, particularly with respect to the new independent States of the former Soviet Union, and of policy initiatives to facilitate the denuclearization of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. Expansion of arms control efforts in the Eurasian region, including consideration of discussions with China on strategic stability, is also part of the Bureau's portfolio. Further, SEA has principal responsibility within the Agency for development and implementation of the Nunn-Lugar program, the Safeguards, Transparency and Irreversibility initiative (to ensure that nuclear warhead dismantlement is irreversible and transparent) and of defense conversion policy and programs related to the former Soviet Union and China. Other areas in which SEA has responsibility include: ballistic missile defense arms control, the Standing Consultative Commission (SCC), the Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC), and the Special Verification Commission (SVC). SEA coordinates implementation of agreed policy, generates and analyzes proposals, and evaluates weapons systems and other questions relating to these negotiations. It also takes the leading role in formulating Agency positions on basic strategic and theater offensive arms control, ballistic missile defense arms control, nuclear warhead dismantlement initiatives and the storage and disposition of fissile material from dismantled nuclear warheads, and other strategic or global arms control and outer space policy issues that require high-level decision within the Government. SEA chairs the interagency backstopping committees for the JCIC, the SCC, the SVC, and the Bilateral Implementation Commission (BIC). The Bureau also provides technical expertise to teams implementing various elements of denuclearization, fissile material disposition, and related openness initiatives, as well as to defense conversion committees and relevant interagency working groups.</P>

          .<P>(a) A written request for records should be addressed to: FOIA Officer, U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 320 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20451. To facilitate processing, the letter of request and envelope should be conspicuously marked “FOIA request.”.</P>

          <P>(b) The request should identify the desired record or reasonably describe it. The identification should be as specific as possible so that a record can be found readily. Blanket requests or requests for “the entire file of” or “all matters relating to” a specified subject will not be accepted. The Agency will make any reasonable effort to assist the requester in sharpening the request to eliminate extraneous and unwanted materials and to keep search and copying fees to a minimum..</P>

          <P>(c) If a fee is chargeable under subpart C of this part for search or duplication costs incurred in connection with a request for an Agency record, the request should include the anticipated fee or should ask for a determination of such fee. Any chargeable fee must be paid in full prior to issuance of requested materials. The method of payment is described in § 602.24..</P>

          <SUBJECT>Copies of records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Agency will provide copies of requested records of the same type and quality that it would provide to personnel of another U.S. Government agency in the course of official business. It will not accept requests for special types of copying processes or for special standards of quality of reproduction.</P>
          <P>(b) Copies of records requested will be reproduced as promptly as possible and mailed to the requester. Chargeable fees will be determined according to the schedule set forth in subpart C of this part.

          <SUBJECT>Overseas requests.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Pursuant to the general policy outlined in § 602.3, ACDA has made arrangements to provide the United States Information Agency (USIA) with material for dissemination abroad, such as information on official U.S. positions on arms control and disarmament policy. Requests originating in an area served by a USIA office which are received at Agency headquarters, will be referred to USIA when appropriate for direct response to the requester.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 602.16</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Responses and time limits on requests.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The FOIA requires an initial determination on a request for an Agency record to be made within ten working days after receipt of the request.</P>
          <P>(b) If it is determined that the requested record (or portions thereof) will be made available, the requested material will be forwarded promptly after the initial determination, provided any applicable fee has been paid in full.</P>

          <P>(c) If prior to making an initial determination it is anticipated that the costs chargeable for a request will amount to more than $25.00 or more than the amount of the payment accompanying the request, whichever is larger, the requester shall be promptly notified of the total amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. In these instances, an advance deposit in the estimated amount of the search, review, and copying costs may be required. The request for an advance deposit shall extend an offer to the requester to consult with Agency personnel in order to <PRTPAGE P="314"/>reformulate the request in a manner that will reduce the fee, yet still meet the needs of the requester.</P>
          <P>(d) In instances where the Agency has requested an advance deposit, the date of receipt of the deposit will be considered as the request date which begins the period of response by the Agency.</P>
          <P>(e) Receipt of a request for Agency records will be determined by the time and date the request is received.</P>
          <P>(f) Where an obvious delay in receipt of a request has occurred, such as in cases where the requester has failed to address the request properly, or where a delay has been caused in the mails, the Agency will dispatch to the requester an acknowledgment of the receipt of the request.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 602.17</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Time extensions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In unusual circumstances, the time limit for an initial or final determination may be extended, but not to exceed a total of ten working days in the aggregate in the processing of any specific request for an Agency record.</P>
          <P>(b) “Unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular case:</P>
          <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from other establishments that are physically separate from ACDA headquarters;</P>
          <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
          <P>(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 602.18</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Inability to comply with requests.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) When a request cannot be fulfilled, the requester will be so informed with reasons, and any fees returned after deduction of applicable search costs. Such reasons may include, but are not limited to the following:</P>
          <P>(1) Insufficient or vague identifying information which makes identification or location of the record impossible;</P>
          <P>(2) No such record in existence;</P>
          <P>(3) Record available for purchase from the Government Printing Office or elsewhere; or</P>
          <P>(4) Records destroyed pursuant to the Records Disposal Act.</P>
          <P>(b) Inability to comply with requests shall be processed the same as denials of records, i.e., notification to the requester shall be in writing, shall set forth the reasons therefor, shall be signed by the name and title of the FOIA Officer, and shall include an explanation of the requester's right to appeal, including the address to which an appeal may be directed.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Predisclosure notification for confidential commercial information</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">When notification is required.</E> If a request under the FOIA seeks a record that contains information submitted by a person or entity outside the Federal government that arguably is exempt from disclosure under exemption 4 of the FOIA because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm, the Agency shall notify the submitter that such a request has been made whenever:</P>
          <P>(1) The submitter has made a good faith designation of information, less than ten years old, as confidential commercial or financial information, or</P>
          <P>(2) The Agency has reason to believe that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification to submitter.</E> The notice to the submitter shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies of the records or portions of records containing the information. The notice shall afford the submitter a reasonable period of time, based on the amount and/or complexity of the information, within which to object to disclosure.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Objection by submitter.</E> Any objection by a submitter to disclosure must be made in writing and sent to: FOIA Officer, U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 320 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20451. It should identify the portion(s) of the information to which disclosure is objected, and should include a detailed statement of <PRTPAGE P="315"/>all claimed grounds for withholding any of the information under the FOIA and, in the case of exemption 4, an explanation of why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged and confidential, including a specification of any claim of competitive or other business harm that would result from disclosure.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification to requester.</E> The Agency shall notify the requester in writing when any notification to a submitter is made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">When notification is not required.</E> Notification to a submitter is not required if:</P>
          <P>(1) The Agency determines that the information requested should not be disclosed;</P>
          <P>(2) Disclosure is required by statute (other than FOIA) or by regulation; or</P>
          <P>(3) The information has previously been lawfully published or officially made available to the public.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> If the Agency determines that despite the objection of the submitter the requested information should be disclosed, in whole or in part, it shall notify both the requester and the submitter of the decision and shall provide to the submitter in writing:</P>
          <P>(1) A brief explanation of why the submitter's objections were not sustained;</P>
          <P>(2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and</P>
          <P>(3) A specified disclosure date that provides a reasonable period of time between receipt of the notice and the disclosure date.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of lawsuit.</E> (1) Whenever a requester brings legal action to compel disclosure of information covered by paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency shall promptly notify the submitter in writing.</P>
          <P>(2) Whenever a submitter brings legal action to prevent disclosure of information covered by paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency shall promptly notify the requester in writing.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 602.20</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees for records search, review, copying, certification, and related services.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The fees for search, review, and copying services for Agency records under the FOIA or the Privacy Act are as follows:</P>
          <P>(a) When documents are requested for commercial use, requesters will be assessed the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing for release, and copying the records sought. A “commercial use” request refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.</P>
          <P>(b) Requesters from educational and noncommercial scientific institutions will be assessed only copying costs.</P>
          <P>(c) Requesters who are representatives of the news media (persons actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public) will be assessed only copying costs.</P>
          <P>(d) All other requesters will be assessed fees which recover the full and reasonable direct cost of searching for, reviewing for release, and copying records that are responsive to the request.</P>
          <P>(e) Requesters from educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, representatives of the news media, and all other noncommercial users, will not be assessed for the first 100 pages of copying or the first two hours of search time. Commercial use requesters will not be entitled to these free services.</P>
          <P>(f) The search and review hourly fees will be based upon employee grade levels in order to recoup the full, allowable direct costs attributable to their performance of these functions.</P>
          <P>(g) The fee for paper copy reproduction will be $.20 per page.</P>

          <P>(h) The fee for duplication of computer tape or printout reproduction or other reproduction (e.g., microfiche) will be the actual, cost, including operator time. <PRTPAGE P="316"/>
          </P>
          <P>(i) If the cost of collecting any fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself, it will not be assessed.</P>
          <P>(j) A fee may be charged for searches that are not productive and for searches for records or parts of records that subsequently are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
          <P>(k) Interest charges may be assessed on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent, at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of billing. The Debt Collection Act, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, will be utilized to encourage payment where appropriate.</P>
          <P>(l) If search charges are likely to exceed $25.00, the requester will be notified of the estimated fees unless the requester's willingness to pay whatever fee is assessed has been provided in advance.</P>
          <P>(m) An advance payment (before work is commenced or continued on a request) may be required if the charges are likely to exceed $250.00. Requesters who have previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of billing) may be required to pay this amount plus any applicable interest (or demonstrate that the fee has been paid) and them make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the new or pending request is processed.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 602.21</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Waiver or reduction of fees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees set forth in § 602.20 if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The following six factors will be employed in determining when such fees shall be waived or reduced:</P>
          <P>(a) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government;”</P>
          <P>(b) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
          <P>(c) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the information will contribute to the “public understanding;”</P>
          <P>(d) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
          <P>(e) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so</P>
          <P>(f) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”</P>

        <SUBJECT>Basis.</SUBJECT>
        <P>These regulations, taken together with the Information Security Oversight Office Directive No. 1 dated October 13, 1995, provide the basis for the security classification program of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) implementing Executive Order 12958, “Classified National Security Information” (the Executive Order).</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 605.2</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Objective.</SUBJECT>
        <P>The objective of the ACDA classification program is to ensure that national security information is protected from unauthorized disclosure, but only to the extent and for such a period as is necessary.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 605.3</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Senior agency official.</SUBJECT>
        <P>The Executive Order requires that each agency that originates or handles classified information designate a senior agency official to direct and administer its information security program. The ACDA senior agency official is the Deputy Director. The Deputy Director is assisted in carrying out the provisions of the Executive Order and the ACDA information security program by the Director of Security and by the Classification Adviser.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 605.4</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Original classification.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Definition. Original classification is the initial determination that certain information requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security (i.e., national defense or foreign relations of the United States), together with a designation of the level of classification.</P>
        <P>(b) Classification designations—(1) <E T="03">Top Secret</E> shall be applied only to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security. Examples of “exceptionally grave damage” include, but are not limited to, armed hostilities against the United States or its allies; <PRTPAGE P="329"/>the compromise of vital national defense plans or cryptologic and communications intelligence systems; the revelation of sensitive intelligence operations; and the disclosure of scientific or technological developments vital to national security.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Secret</E> shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security. Examples of “serious damage” include, but are not limited to, disruption of foreign relations significantly affecting the national security; significant impairment of a program or policy directly related to the national security; revelation of significant military plans or intelligence operations; and compromise of significant scientific or technological developments relating to national security.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Confidential</E> shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.</P>
        <P>(c) Classification restraints. (1) The classification level of any form of information is premised on an evaluation of its contents as a whole, as well as on its relationship to other information.</P>
        <P>(2) In classifying information, the public's interest in access to government information must be balanced against the need to protect national security information.</P>
        <P>(3) In case of doubt, the lower level of classification is to be used.</P>
        <P>(d) Duration of classification. (1) Information shall be classified for as long as is required by national security considerations, subject to the limitations set forth in section 1.6 of the Executive Order. When it can be determined, a specific date or event for declassification shall be set by the original classification authority at the time the information is originally classified. If a specific date or event for declassification cannot be determined, information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original decision, except that the original classification authority may classify for a period greater than 10 years specific information that falls within the criteria set forth in section 1.6(d) of the Executive Order.</P>
        <P>(2) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification or reclassify specific information for successive periods not to exceed 10 years at a time except for records that are more than 25 years old.</P>
        <P>(3) Information classified for an indefinite duration under predecessor orders, such as “Originating Agency's Determination Required,” shall be subject to the declassification provisions of Part 3 of the Executive Order, including the provisions of section 3.4 regarding automatic declassification of records older than 25 years.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 605.5</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Classification authority.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Classification shall be solely on the basis of national security considerations. In no case shall information be classified in order to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error, or to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Designations.</E> The following ACDA officials shall have original classification authority in each of the three designations under which they are shown below. This authority vests only in the officials or positions designated and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not be redelegated. In the absence of any of the authorized classifiers (for TDY outside Washington, annual leave, temporary position vacancy, etc.), the officer acting in that person's position may exercise the classifier's authority.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Top Secret.</E> (i) Director,</P>
        <P>(ii) Deputy Director.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Secret.</E> (i) Officials having Top Secret classification authority,</P>
        <P>(ii) such other officials who have a frequent need to exercise Secret authority and are specifically delegated this authority in writing by the Director.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Confidential.</E> (i) Officials having Top Secret and Secret classification authority,</P>

        <P>(ii) Other officials who have a frequent need to exercise Confidential authority and are specifically delegated this authority in writing by the Director.<PRTPAGE P="330"/>
        </P>
        <P>(c) Delegation of classification authority. (1) The Executive Order restricts delegation of original classification authority to officials who have a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise such authority. Such delegations shall be held to a minimum.</P>
        <P>(2) If in the judgment of bureau or office heads an officer has a demonstrable need for classification authority, a written request over the bureau or office head's signature should be forwarded via the Director of Security to the Deputy Director for action. The request should set forth the officer's name and title, the justification for having the authority, and the level of classification authority sought.</P>
        <P>(3) The Director of Security shall maintain a complete current list by classification designation of individuals to whom and positions to which original classification authority has been delegated.</P>
        <P>(4) Periodic reviews of delegations of classification authority will be made by the Director of Security to ensure that officials so designated have a continuing need to exercise such authority. Recommendations by the Director of Security for discontinuance of delegations will be forwarded to the Deputy Director for action.</P>
        <P>(5) Original classification authority shall not be delegated to persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply classifications markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide.</P>
        <P>(d) Classification responsibilities. Each ACDA officer who signs, authenticates, or otherwise produces a document is responsible for determining that it is properly classified and marked. This responsibility includes determining whether the document contains any originally classified material (in which case the classification must be authorized by an appropriate ACDA classifying official) or contains information already classified (in which case the proper derivative markings must be applied). Any significant doubt about the level of classification shall be resolved in favor of the lower level.</P>
        <P>(e) Classification challenges. Holders of information who believe that its classification status is improper are expected and encouraged to challenge the need for classification, the classification level, the duration of classification, the lack of classification or other aspect believed to be improper. Classification challenges shall be directed to and decided by the Deputy Director. If the information was not originated within or classified by ACDA, it will be referred to the Classification Adviser for coordination with the responsible agency or department if declassification, downgrading, classification or other change in its status appears to be warranted. Individuals making challenges to the classification status of information shall not be subject to retribution for such action, and they shall be advised of their right to appeal the Deputy Director's decision on the challenge to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel established by section 5.4 of the Executive Order.</P>
        <P>(f) Contractor classification authority. (1) Each ACDA contract calling for classified work shall be processed under the National Industrial Security Program.</P>
        <P>(2) Each contract processed under the National Industrial Security Program requires the preparation of a contract security classification specification (DD 254) which serves as the contractor's guidance and authority to apply classification markings.</P>
        <P>(3) Each contract processed under the Department of Energy (DOE) Security Requirements (i.e., involving restricted data or formerly restricted data) shall include a provision for naming a classification coordinator in the contractor organization. This individual shall coordinate the derived classification of all documents prepared under the contract in accordance with guidance received from ACDA via the ACDA Contracting Officer's Technical Representative for the contract, or by direct consultation on classification problems with the ACDA Classification Adviser or the Director of Security.</P>

        <P>(4) Only designated officials of the U.S. Government may originally classify information. Contractor personnel, as potential developers of classified information, must follow the guidelines <PRTPAGE P="331"/>outlined in paragraph (d) of this section entitled “Classification Responsibilities.” When there is a question involving the original classification of information, the contractor is obligated to safeguard it in accordance with the classification designation deemed appropriate and submit recommendations to ACDA for classification determination.</P>
        <P>(5) In general, the classification of the information provided by ACDA for use or reference in the completion of the contract will be the source of the classification of documents prepared under the contract.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 605.6</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Derivative classification.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating or generating in new form information that is already classified and the marking of the new material consistent with the classification of the source material. Duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not derivative classification.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibility.</E> Derivative application of classification markings is the responsibility of those who prepare material using information that is already classified and of those who apply markings in accordance with instructions from an authorized classifier or in accordance with an authorized classification guide.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Classification guides.</E> (1) Classification guides used to direct derivative classification and issued by ACDA shall specifically identify the information to be protected, using categorization to the extent necessary to ensure that the information involved can be identified readily and uniformly.</P>
        <P>(2) Each classification guide issued by ACDA shall be approved by the Senior Agency Official.</P>
        <P>(3) Each classification guide issued by ACDA shall be kept current and shall be reviewed as required by directives issued under the Executive Order. The Director of Security shall maintain a list of all classification guides.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 605.7</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Declassification and downgrading.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Declassification processes.</E> Declassification of classified information may occur:</P>
        <P>(1) after review of material in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), mandatory declassification review, discovery, subpoena, or other information access or declassification request;</P>
        <P>(2) after review as part of ACDA's systematic declassification review program;</P>
        <P>(3) as a result of the elapse of the time or the occurrence of the event specified at the time of classification;</P>
        <P>(4) by operation of the automatic declassification provisions of section 3.4 of the Executive Order with respect to material more than 25 years old.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Downgrading.</E> When material classified at the Top Secret level is reviewed for declassification and it is determined that classification continues to be warranted, a determination shall be made whether downgrading to a lower level of classification is appropriate. If downgrading is determined to be warranted, the classification level of the material shall be changed to the appropriate lower level.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Authority to downgrade and declassify.</E> (1) Classified information may be downgraded or declassified by the official who originally classified the information if that official is still serving in the same position, by a successor in that capacity, by a supervisory official of either, by the Classification Adviser, or by any other official specifically designated by the Deputy Director. Contractor personnel do not have authority to downgrade or declassify.</P>
        <P>(2) The Director of Security shall maintain a record of ACDA officials specifically designated by the Deputy Director as declassification authorities.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Declassification after balancing public interest.</E> It is presumed that information that continues to meet classification requirements requires continued protection. In exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be referred to the ACDA official with Top Secret authority having primary jurisdiction over the information in question. That official, after consultation with the <PRTPAGE P="332"/>Public Affairs Adviser and the Classification Adviser, will determine whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to national security that reasonably could be expected from disclosure. If the determination is made that the information should be declassified and disclosed, that official will make such a recommendation to the Director or the Deputy Director who shall make the decision on declassification and disclosure.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Public dissemination of declassified information.</E> Declassification of information is not authorization for its public disclosure. Previously classified information that is declassified may be subject to withholding from public disclosure under the FOIA, the Privacy Act, and various statutory confidentiality provisions.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 605.8</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Mandatory declassification review.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Action on requests.</E> (1) All requests to ACDA by a member of the public, a government employee, or an agency to declassify and release information shall result in a prompt declassification review of the information, provided the request describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable ACDA to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort.</P>
        <P>(2) If a request does not reasonably describe the information sought, the Classification Adviser will notify the requester that unless additional information is provided or the scope of the request is narrowed, no further action will be taken.</P>
        <P>(3) Mandatory declassification review requests should be directed to the Classification Adviser, U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 320 21st St., NW., Washington, DC 20451.</P>
        <P>(4) If the request requires the rendering of services for which reasonable fees should be charged pursuant to the FOIA and ACDA regulations thereunder (22 CFR part 602), such fees shall be imposed at the FOIA schedule rates and the requester shall be so notified.</P>
        <P>(5) The Classification Adviser, in consultation with appropriate ACDA bureaus and offices, will determine whether, under the Executive Order, the requested information may be declassified, in whole or in part, and will promptly make any declassified information available to the requester, unless the information is exempt from disclosure under some other provision of law.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeals from denials.</E> (1) If it is determined that declassification of the information requested is not warranted, in whole or in part, the requester shall be given a brief statement as to the reasons for the decision, a notice of the right to appeal to the Deputy Director, and a notice that any such appeal must be filed with ACDA within 60 days. Appeals shall be addressed to: Deputy Director, U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 320 21st St., NW., Washington, DC 20451.</P>
        <P>(2) The Deputy Director shall act within 30 days of receipt on all appeals of denials of requests for declassification. The Deputy Director shall determine whether continued classification is required in whole or in part. If the Deputy Director determines that continued classification is required under the Executive Order, the requester shall be so notified and informed of the reasons therefor. The requester shall also be advised of the right to appeal any denial to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel in accordance with section 5.4 of the Executive Order.</P>
        <P>(c) Information classified by another agency. When ACDA receives a request for information in its custody that was classified by another agency, the Classification Adviser shall forward the request together with a copy of the document containing the information requested to the classifying agency for review and direct response to the requester. Unless the agency that classified the information objects on the ground that its association with the information requires protection, the Classification Adviser shall also notify the requester of the referral.</P>

        <P>(d) Confirmation of existence or nonexistence of document. In responding to a request for mandatory declassification review, the Classification Adviser may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of a document if the fact of its existence or nonexistence would itself be classifiable under the Executive Order. <PRTPAGE P="333"/>

        <SUBJECT>Systematic declassification review.</SUBJECT>
        <P>The Classification Adviser shall be responsible for conducting a program for systematic declassification review of historically valuable records that were exempted from the automatic declassification provisions of section 3.4 of the Executive Order. The FOIA officer shall prioritize such review on the basis of the recommendations of the Information Security Policy Advisory Council established under section 5.5 of the Executive Order and on the degree of researcher interest and likelihood of declassification upon review.</P>

          <P>(a)(1) An employee shall not receive or solicit, directly or indirectly for himself or persons with whom he has family, business, or financial ties, anything of economic value as a gift, gratuity, loan, entertainment, or favor, which might reasonably be interpreted by others as affecting his independence or impartiality, from any person, corporation, or group, if the employee has reason to believe that the entity:</P>

          <P>(a)(1) Neither a regular nor a special Government employee may participate in his governmental capacity in any matter in which he, his spouse, minor child, associate or organization with whom he has a business relationship, or person or organization with whom he is negotiating for employment has a financial interest (18 U.S.C. 208). Such an employee shall not (i) have a direct <PRTPAGE P="337"/>or indirect financial interest that conflicts substantially, or appears to conflict substantially, with his Government duties and responsibilities; or (ii) engage in, directly or indirectly, a financial transaction as a result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through his Government employment.</P>

          <P>(2) Exceptions.

          <P>(b) Pursuant to the provisions of section 208(b)(2) of title 18, United States Code, the following financial interests of the Agency's employees are hereby exempted from the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the Agency's employees:</P>
          <P>(1) Investments in State and local government bonds; and stocks, bonds, or policies in a mutual fund, investment company, bank, or insurance company, provided that in the case of a mutual fund, investment company, or bank the fair value of such stock or bond holding does not exceed 1 percent of the value of the reported assets of the mutual fund, investment company, or bank. In the case of a mutual fund or investment company, this exemption applies only where the assets of the fund or company are diversified; it does not apply where the fund or company specializes in a particular industry or commodity.</P>
          <P>(2) Interest in an investment club or other group organized for the purpose of investing in equity or debt securities, provided, that the fair value of the interest involved does not exceed $5,000, and that the interest does not exceed one-fourth of the total assets of the investment club or group.</P>
          <P>(3)(i) Financial interests in an enterprise in the form of shares in the ownership thereof, including preferred and common stocks whether voting or non-voting, and warrants to purchase such shares;</P>
          <P>(ii) Financial interests in an enterprise in the form of bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness;</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, in the case of paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section: <E T="03">(a)</E> The total market value of the financial interests described in said subdivisions with respect to any individual enterprise does not exceed $5,000; and <E T="03">(b)</E> the holdings in any class of shares, or bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness, of the enterprise do not exceed 1 percent of the dollar value of the outstanding shares, or bonds or other evidences of indebtedness in said class.</FP>
          <P>(4) For purposes of this paragraph, computations of dollar-value of financial interests in enterprises shall be based on:</P>
          <P>(i) Market value in the case of stocks listed on national exchanges; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Over-the-counter market quotations as reported by the National Daily Quotation Service in the case of unlisted stocks; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Net book value (assets less liabilities) in the case of stocks not covered by the preceding two categories;</P>
          <P>(iv) Face value shall be used for valuation purposes in the case of debt securities.</P>
          <P>(c) Neither a regular nor a special Government employee, may, directly or indirectly make use of, or permit those with whom he has family, business, or financial ties to make use of, official information obtained through or in connection with his Government employment and not made available to the general public, for the purpose of furthering a private interest, including speculation in commodities, land, and securities.</P>

          <P>(d) This paragraph does not preclude teaching, speaking, or writing by employees duly authorized under this part. Further, this paragraph does not <PRTPAGE P="338"/>preclude an employee from having a financial interest or engaging in financial transactions to the same extent as a private citizen not employed by the Government so long as it is not prohibited by law, the Executive order, this section, or the agency regulations.

          <P>Employees are encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and writing that is not prohibited by law, the Executive order, this part, or the agency regulations. However, an employee shall not, either for or without compensation, engage in teaching, lecturing, or writing, including teaching, lecturing, or writing for the purpose of the special preparation of a person or class of persons for an examination of the Commission or Board of Examiners for the Foreign <PRTPAGE P="340"/>Service, that depends on information obtained as a result of his Government employment, except when that information has been made available to the general public or will be made available on request, or when the agency head gives written authorization for use of nonpublic information on the basis that the use is in the public interest. In addition, an employee who is a Presidential appointee covered by section 401 (a) of the order shall not receive compensation or anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the responsibilities, programs or operations of his agency, or which draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part of the body of public information.

          <SUBJECT>Acceptance of invitations to speak or to accept teaching engagements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Participation of ACDA personnel in speaking engagements can greatly assist public understanding of U.S. arms control and disarmament policies and positions. In order, however, to reduce risk of unintentional security disclosure or contravention of Government policy, ACDA employees, including special Government employees, shall obtain prior approval, as follows:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Acceptance of invitations to speak.</E> Any invitation to appear as a representative of the Agency or to speak, comment, or participate in a conference on matters related to its work shall be referred to the Public Affairs Office for decision and action. Information on the sponsoring organization, date, place, subject matter, type of audience, and estimated travel expenses as indicated on an Agency form must be in the Public Affairs Office before invitations may be accepted. The Public Affairs Office shall control all negotiations with the prospective host and may authorize or approve outside payment of travel and reasonable subsistence expenses under appropriate circumstances.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Clearance of texts of public addresses.</E> The full text or detailed outline (as agreed by the employee and Public Affairs Adviser) of each public address on U.S. foreign policy or ACDA activities shall be submitted to the Public Affairs Adviser for clearance with the Agency Classification Officer and for appropriate clearance within ACDA and, as deemed necessary, outside the Agency.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Release to news media.</E> The text or outline of any public address, after clearance and coordination, may be released to news media by the Public Affairs Adviser, if appropriate.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Professional meetings and conferences.</E> When an employee is invited to participate in a public professional meeting, conference, or discussion panel on matters related to the work of the Agency where, because of the nature of the public appearance, no prepared script or outline will be available for clearance, the employee must obtain clearance of acceptance from the Public Affairs Adviser and from the Agency Classification Officer. The participant himself is responsible for ensuring that his remarks involve no violation of security and are consistent with United States policy.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Acceptance of teaching engagements.</E> (1) Any employee who contemplates acceptance of a teaching engagement shall notify the Public Affairs Adviser of his intention. He shall also submit to the Office of the Executive Director information covering the name of the educational institution, the frequency of classes and periods of time involved, and a comprehensive description of the course to be taught. If the subject matter does not involve United States policy or ACDA activities, the Executive Director may approve acceptance of the teaching engagement. If the subject matter includes either of the above-mentioned matters, only the Director of ACDA may approve the employee's acceptance of the teaching engagement. All <PRTPAGE P="341"/>approvals of teaching engagements must be renewed prior to the beginning of each school year.</P>
          <P>(2) Exception: A special Government employee must obtain the required clearances only when the subject matter involves U.S. policy or ACDA activities to which he is privy through his ACDA employment.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Additional clearance measures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Any ACDA employee who contemplates accepting an invitation to speak or to teach shall initially discuss the proposed invitation with the head of the Bureau or Office to which it is assigned and, as appropriate, with the Agency Classification Officer. Informal approval by the Bureau or Office head and, if appropriate, by the Agency Classification Officer, is a prerequisite for the clearances specified in § 606.735-33.</P>
          <P>(b) Exception: The exception to § 606.735-33(e)(1) applies.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Writing for publication.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Occasionally officers of ACDA have prepared documents pertinent to arms control and disarmament for publication other than in the official capacity of the Public Affairs Adviser or of the Office of the General Counsel in its congressional liaison functions. The Agency welcomes such activity as being in keeping with one of its four major functions—“the dissemination and coordination of public information concerning arms control and disarmament.” However, all such documents authored by ACDA personnel, which bear directly or indirectly on matters, involving the functions, activities, operations, or interest of ACDA, or which deal with U.S. foreign policy, must receive appropriate Agency clearance for publication. This is true whether or not a document for publication is prepared within the scope of an ACDA employee's official duties.</P>
          <P>(b) Authorization for publication: (1) Clearance of a document for publication is primarily a function of the Public Affairs Adviser, but other components of the Agency share a responsibility for clearance.</P>
          <P>(2) Prior to submitting the document to the Public Affairs Adviser, the author shall obtain clearance of the document from his own bureau or office head; obtain clearance of the document from ACDA's Security Classification Officer; and obtain additional clearances within ACDA and from other Government agencies as deemed appropriate by his bureau or office head.</P>
          <P>(3) When requesting clearance by the Public Affairs Advisers, the author shall submit to the Public Affairs Adviser a copy of the document to be reviewed together with a memorandum detailing the nature of his request, indicating whether the document proposed for publication would note the author's connection with ACDA, stating whether an honorarium or any form of remuneration is involved, and noting compliance with the requirements specified under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section.</P>

          <P>(4) The Public Affairs Adviser shall be responsible for making a final determination on the propriety of publication and, if publication is approved, on the extent of attribution or nonattribution to the Agency, the adequacy of the disclaimer if attribution is made, and the propriety of an honorarium or other form of remuneration if this factor is involved. The Public Affairs Adviser shall obtain the approval of the Office of the General Counsel on the acceptance of an honorarium and may seek the General Counsel's recommendation on other pertinent matters.

          <P>(ii) In a matter pending before the agency he serves unless he has served there on no more than 60 days during the past 365 (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205).

Unless the conflict or apparent conflict is resolved as a result of the discussion, the information concerning the matter shall be reported to the Director of ACDA through the General Counsel, who is counselor for the Agency.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.</SUBJECT>
        <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 607.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
        <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>
        <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 607.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>

        <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons; <PRTPAGE P="350"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
        <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
        <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

        <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
        <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
        <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>

The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
        <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 607.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope; definitions.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) This part sets forth the procedures to be followed with respect to:</P>
        <P>(1) service of summonses and complaints or other requests or demands directed to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA, the Agency) or to any ACDA employee or former employee in connection with federal or state litigation arising out of or involving the performance of official activities of ACDA; and</P>
        <P>(2) the oral or written disclosure, in response to subpoenas, orders, or other requests or demands of federal or state judicial or quasi-judicial authority (collectively, “demands”), whether civil or criminal in nature, or in response to requests for depositions, affidavits, admissions, responses to interrogatories, document production, or other litigation-related matters, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, or applicable state rules (collectively, “requests”), of any material contained in the files of the Agency, any information relating to material contained in the files of the Agency, or any information acquired while the subject of the demand or request is or was an employee of the Agency as part of the performance of the person's duties or by virtue of the person's official status.</P>
        <P>(b) For purposes of this part, and except as ACDA may otherwise determine in a particular case, the term employee includes the Director of ACDA and former Directors of ACDA, and all employees and former employees of ACDA or other federal agencies who are or were appointed by, or subject to the supervision, jurisdiction, or control of the Director of ACDA, whether residing or working in the United States or abroad, including United States nationals, foreign nationals, and contractors.</P>
        <P>(c) For purposes of this part, the term <E T="03">litigation</E> encompasses all pre-trial, trial, and post-trial stages of all judicial or administrative actions, hearings, investigations, or similar proceedings before courts, commissions, boards, or other judicial or quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, whether criminal, civil, or administrative in nature. This part governs, inter alia, responses to discovery requests, depositions, and other pre-trial, trial, or post-trial proceedings, as well as responses to informal requests by attorneys or others in situations involving litigation. However, this part shall not apply to any claims by ACDA employees (present or former), or applicants for Agency employment, for which jurisdiction resides with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board; the Office of Special Counsel; the Federal Labor Relations Authority; the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board; the Foreign Service Grievance Board; or a labor arbitrator operating under a collective bargaining agreement between ACDA and a labor organization representing ACDA employees; or their successor agencies or entities.</P>
        <P>(d) For purposes of this part, <E T="03">official information</E> means all information of any kind, however stored, that is in the custody and control of ACDA, relates to information in the custody and control of ACDA, or was acquired by ACDA employees as part of their official duties or because of their official status within ACDA while such individuals are employed by or served on behalf of ACDA.</P>
        <P>(e) Nothing in this part affects disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, Executive Order 12958, 3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333, the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b, the Agency's regulations in 22 CFR chapter VI implementing any of the foregoing, or pursuant to congressional subpoena. Nothing in this part otherwise permits disclosure of information by ACDA or its employees except as provided by statute or other applicable law.</P>
        <P>(f) This part is intended only to inform the public about ACDA procedures concerning the service of process and responses to demands or requests and is not intended to and does not create, and may not be relied upon to create, any right or benefit substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against ACDA or the United States.</P>
        <P>(g) Nothing in this part affects: <PRTPAGE P="353"/>
        </P>
        <P>(1) The disclosure of information during the course of legal proceedings in foreign courts, commissions, boards, or other judicial or quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals; or</P>
        <P>(2) The rules and procedures, under applicable U.S. law and international conventions, governing diplomatic and consular immunity.</P>
        <P>(h) Nothing in this part affects the disclosure of official information to other federal agencies or Department of Justice attorneys in connection with litigation conducted on behalf or in defense of the United States, its agencies, officers, and employees, or to federal, state, local, or foreign prosecuting and law enforcement authorities in conjunction with criminal law enforcement investigations, prosecutions, extradition, deportation or other proceedings.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 608.2</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Service of summonses and complaints.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Only ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate, is authorized to receive and accept summonses or complaints sought to be served upon ACDA or ACDA employees. All such documents should be delivered or addressed to General Counsel, U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 320 21st St. NW., Room 5635, Washington, DC 20451. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 659(b) and 5 U.S.C. 5520a(c)(1), this same officer has been designated specifically to accept service of process for the enforcement of the legal obligation to provide child support or to make alimony payments by employees of the Agency and to accept service of process for the enforcement of the legal obligation to pay monies owed for other than child support or alimony by employees of the Agency, respectively.</P>
        <P>(b) In the event any summons or complaint described in § 608.1(a) is delivered to an employee of ACDA other than in the manner specified in this part, such attempted service shall be ineffective, and the recipient thereof shall either decline to accept the proffered service or return such document under cover of a written communication which directs the person attempting to make service to the procedures set forth in this part.</P>
        <P>(c) Except as otherwise provided in §§ 608.2(d) and 608.3(c), ACDA is not an authorized agent for service of process with respect to civil litigation against ACDA employees purely in their personal, non-official capacity. Copies of summonses or complaints directed to ACDA employees in connection with legal proceedings arising out of the performance of official duties may, however, be served upon ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate.</P>
        <P>(d) Although ACDA is not an agent for the service of process upon its employees with respect to purely personal, non-official litigation, ACDA recognizes that its employees stationed overseas should not use their official positions to evade their personal obligations and will, therefore, counsel and encourage ACDA employees to accept service of process in appropriate cases, and will waive applicable diplomatic or consular privileges and immunities when ACDA determines that it is in the interest of the United States to do so. Pursuant to section 302 of Executive Order 12953 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 325), ACDA's General Counsel has been designated in Appendix B to 5 CFR part 581 as the official to assist in the service of legal process in civil actions pursuant to orders of State courts to establish paternity and to establish or to enforce support obligations by making ACDA employees available for service of process, regardless of the location of the employee's workplace.</P>
        <P>(e) Documents for which ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate, accepts service in official capacity only shall be stamped “Service Accepted in Official Capacity Only.” Acceptance of service shall not constitute an admission or waiver with respect to jurisdiction, propriety of service, improper venue, or any other defense in law or equity available under the laws or rules applicable for the service of process.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 608.3</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Service of subpoenas, court orders, and other demands or requests for official information or action.</SUBJECT>

        <P>(a) Except in cases in which ACDA is represented by legal counsel who have entered an appearance or otherwise given notice of their representation, <PRTPAGE P="354"/>only ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate, is authorized to receive and accept subpoenas, or other demands or requests directed to ACDA or any component thereof, or its employees, or former employees, whether civil or criminal in nature, for:</P>
        <P>(1) Material, including documents, contained in the files of the Agency;</P>
        <P>(2) Information, including testimony, affidavits, declarations, admissions, response to interrogatories, or informal statements, relating to material contained in the files of the Agency or which any Agency employee acquired in the course and scope of the performance of official duties;</P>
        <P>(3) Garnishment or attachment of compensation of current or former employees; or</P>
        <P>(4) The performance or non-performance of any official ACDA duty.</P>
        <P>(b) In the event that any subpoena, demand, or request is sought to be delivered to an Agency employee (including former employee) other than in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, such attempted service shall be ineffective. Such employee shall, after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, decline to accept the subpoena, demand, or request or shall return it to the server under cover of a written communication referring to the procedures prescribed in this part.</P>
        <P>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this part, ACDA is not an agent for service or otherwise authorized to accept on behalf of its employees any subpoenas, show-cause orders, or similar compulsory process of federal or state courts, or requests from private individuals or attorneys, which are not related to the employees’ official duties except upon the express, written authorization of the individual ACDA employee to whom such demand or request is directed.</P>
        <P>(d) Acceptance of such documents by ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate, does not constitute a waiver of any defenses that might otherwise exist with respect to service under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or other applicable rules.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 608.4</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Testimony and production of documents prohibited unless approved by appropriate Agency officials.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) No employee of ACDA shall, in response to a demand or request in connection with any litigation, whether criminal or civil, provide oral or written testimony by deposition,declaration, affidavit, or otherwise concerning any information acquired while such person is or was an employee of ACDA as part of the performance of that person's official duties or by virtue of that person's official status, unless authorized to do so by ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate.</P>
        <P>(b) No ACDA employee shall, in response to a demand or request in connection with any litigation, produce for use at such proceedings any document or any other material acquired as part of the performance of that employee's duties or by virtue of that employee's official status, unless authorized to do so by ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 608.5</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Procedure when testimony or production of documents is sought—general.</SUBJECT>

        <P>(a) If official ACDA information is sought, through testimony or otherwise, by a request or demand, the party seeking such release or testimony must (except as otherwise required by federal law or authorized by the Office of the General Counsel) set forth in writing and with as much specificity as possible, the nature and relevance of the official information sought. Where documents or other materials are sought, the party should identify the record or reasonably describe it in terms of date, format, subject matter, the office originating or receiving the record, and the names of all persons to whom the record is known to relate. Subject to § 606.7, ACDA employees may produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning only those matters that were specified in writing and properly approved by ACDA's General Counsel or his/her delegate. See <E T="03">United States ex rel. Touhy</E> v. <E T="03">Ragen,</E> 340 U.S. 462 (1951). The Office of <PRTPAGE P="355"/>the General Counsel may waive this requirement in appropriate circumstances.</P>
        <P>(b) To the extent it deems necessary or appropriate, ACDA may also require from the party seeking such testimony or documents a plan of all reasonably foreseeable demands, including but not limited to the names of all employees and former employees from whom discovery will be sought, areas of inquiry, expected duration of proceedings requiring oral testimony, and identification of potentially relevant documents.</P>
        <P>(c) ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate, will notify the ACDA employee and such other persons as circumstances may warrant of the decision regarding compliance with the request or demand.</P>
        <P>(d) The Office of the General Counsel will consult with the Department of Justice regarding legal representation for ACDA employees in appropriate cases.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 608.6</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Procedure when response to demand is required prior to receiving instructions.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) If a response to a demand is required before ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate, renders a decision, ACDA will request that either a Department of Justice attorney or an ACDA attorney designated for the purpose:</P>
        <P>(1) Appear with the employee upon whom the demand has been made;</P>
        <P>(2) Furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this part;</P>
        <P>(3) Inform the court or other authority that the demand has been or is being, as the case may be, referred for the prompt consideration of ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate; and</P>
        <P>(4) Respectfully request the court or authority to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions.</P>
        <P>(b) In the event that an immediate demand for production or disclosure is made in circumstances that would preclude the proper designation or appearance of a Department of Justice or ACDA attorney on the employee's behalf, the employee shall respectfully request the demanding court or authority for a reasonable stay of proceedings for the purpose of obtaining instructions from ACDA.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 608.7</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.</SUBJECT>

        <P>If the court or other judicial or quasi-judicial authority declines to stay the effect of the demand in response to a request made pursuant to § 608.6, or if the court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of the Agency's instructions not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the employee upon whom the demand has been made shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing these regulations and <E T="03">United States ex rel. Touhy</E> v. <E T="03">Ragen,</E> 340 U.S. 463 (1951).</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 608.8</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Considerations in determining whether the Agency will comply with a demand or request.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) In deciding whether to comply with a demand or request, ACDA officials and attorneys shall consider, among others:</P>
        <P>(1) Whether such compliance would be unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;</P>
        <P>(2) Whether compliance is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege or disclosure of information;</P>
        <P>(3) The public interest;</P>
        <P>(4) The need to conserve the time of ACDA employees for the conduct of official business;</P>
        <P>(5) The need to avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes;</P>
        <P>(6) The need to maintain impartiality between private litigants in cases where a substantial government interest is not implicated;</P>
        <P>(7) Whether compliance would have an adverse effect on performance by ACDA of its mission and duties; and</P>
        <P>(8) The need to avoid involving ACDA in controversial issues not related to its mission.</P>

        <P>(b) Among those demands and requests in response to which compliance will not ordinarily be authorized are <PRTPAGE P="356"/>those with respect to which, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> any of the following factors exist:</P>
        <P>(1) Compliance would violate a statute or a rule of procedure;</P>
        <P>(2) Compliance would violate a specific regulation or executive order;</P>
        <P>(3) Compliance would reveal information properly classified in the interest of national security;</P>
        <P>(4) Compliance would reveal confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets without the owner's consent;</P>
        <P>(5) Compliance would reveal the internal deliberative processes of the Executive Branch; or</P>
        <P>(6) Compliance would potentially impede or prejudice an on-going law enforcement investigation.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 608.9</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Prohibition on providing expert or opinion testimony.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Except as provided in this section, and subject to 5 CFR 2635.805, ACDA employees shall not provide opinion or expert testimony based upon information which they acquired in the scope and performance of their official ACDA duties, except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the Department of Justice.</P>
        <P>(b) Upon a showing by the requester of exceptional need or unique circumstances and that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of the United States, ACDA's General Counsel, or his/her delegate, may, consistent with 5 CFR 2635.805, in the exercise of discretion, grant special, written authorization for ACDA employees to appear and testify as expert witnesses at no expense to the United States.</P>

        <P>(c) If, despite the final determination of ACDA's General Counsel, a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate authority orders the appearance and expert or opinion testimony of an ACDA employee, such employee shall immediately inform the office of the General Counsel of such order. If the Office of the General Counsel determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's order will be made, the ACDA employee shall comply with the order. If so directed by the Office of the General Counsel, however, the employee shall respectfully decline to testify. See <E T="03">United States ex rel. Touhy</E> v. <E T="03">Ragen,</E> 340 U.S. 462 (1951).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part is adopted pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. It establishes the procedures governing public access to information contained in the files, documents and records of the Corporation. It also sets forth the procedures by which persons submitting written information to the Corporation may designate such information as exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); and provides submitters of confidential business information with the right to be notified of a request for disclosure and to object to the disclosure of such information.</P>
            <P>(b) This part reflects the policy of the Corporation to honor all requests for the disclosure of Corporation records provided that such disclosure does not adversely affect a legitimate public or private interest, is required and/or not prohibited by law or other authority, and would not impose an unreasonable burden on the Corporation. However, this part also reflects the view of the Corporation that the soundness and viability of many of its programs depend in large measure upon the willingness of applicants for Corporation assistance to provide full and reliable commercial, financial, technical and business information relating to the conduct of their affairs. Since the release of such information may imperil the competitive business position and credit standing of an applicant, it is essential that applicants be assured that confidential commercial or financial information which is submitted to the Corporation will not be disclosed to the public. This part is designed in part to give this assurance and thereby to encourage applicants to make complete disclosure of information bearing upon an application for OPIC assistance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>

            <P>This part applies to all files, documents, records, and information obtained or produced by officers and employees of the Corporation in the <PRTPAGE P="359"/>course of their official duties and/or under such officer or employee's control. Specific types of files, documents, records and items of information described herein are illustrative rather than exclusive. This part does not purport to describe or set forth every file, document, record or item of information which may or may not be disclosed or to incorporate every exemption from disclosure provided by law.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 706.13</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as may be otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all terms used in this part which are defined in the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 shall have the same meaning.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Act</E> means the “Freedom of Information Act,” as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Business information</E> means trade secrets or confidential or privileged commercial or financial information obtained from any person, including but not necessarily limited to such information as is contained in individual case files relating to such activities as insurance, loans and loan guarantees.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Business submitter</E> means any person or entity which provides business information to the Corporation.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that is related to the commerce, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. The term <E T="03">commercial use requester</E> refers to any person making a commercial use request. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Corporation will determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Where the Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Corporation may seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures which the Corporation actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a request under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a document available to the FOIA requester. Copies will be ordinarily in the form of a photocopy of the original document.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of vocational education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">FOIA</E> means the Act.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals, but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news” who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of “freelance” journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Corporation may also look to <PRTPAGE P="360"/>the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a “commercial use request” under the Act (as the term “commercial use request” is defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. The term “review” includes processing any documents for disclosure, including doing all that is necessary to excise exempt portions and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to request, including a page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Line-by-line search will not be done when duplicating an entire document would prove to be the less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request.</P>

Persons desiring such access may request an appointment by telephoning the Claims Assistant at (202) 457-7019 or by writing the Corporation to the attention of such officer. Although the Corporation will endeavor to grant an appointment at the time requested, some delay may be required at times because of the small size of the Corporation's staff. Persons desiring access to the public information files should seek an appointment at least twenty-four hours in advance.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Access to public information files on board matters.</E> Access by any member of the public to the Corporation's public information files described in § 706.21(d) shall be granted by appointment only.

Such request shall, to the extent required under the law, accurately describe the records as to which access or duplication is requested including, by way of example only, the subject matter, format, date, and where pertinent, the country, project or person involved.

            <P>Persons making a request for disclosure normally will be notified of the availability of the material within ten working days after the date of receipt of the request. The information or records subject to release shall be made available promptly provided the requirements of § 706.26 regarding payment of fees are satisfied.

            <SUBJECT>Extension of time.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Although the Corporation will make every effort to respond to an initial request for disclosure of information within ten working days, there may be delays because of the Corporation's limited staff. Moreover, in certain circumstances the period of time within which the Corporation will respond to an initial request will be extended by <PRTPAGE P="362"/>an additional ten working days. Circumstances which would necessitate such an extension include the following:</P>
            <P>(a) The need to search for and collect requested records from storage facilities located outside Corporation premises;</P>
            <P>(b) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request;</P>
            <P>(c) The need for consultation with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein; or</P>
            <P>(d) The need to notify the submitter of confidential business information of the request and to allow a reasonable period for objection to disclosure per § 706.31 of this part.</P>
            <FP>It is the practice of the Corporation to inform a requester in writing or by telephone of any anticipated delays.</FP>

            <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General policy.</E> A fee representing direct costs shall be charged for services rendered by the Corporation under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) in furnishing information to members of the public, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and as required or permitted by law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Anticipated fees.</E> A letter requesting a document or information should specifically state that all costs chargeable under this section will be paid or, alternatively that they will be paid up to a specified limit. If the letter makes no reference to anticipated fees, and the request is expected to involve fees in excess of $25, or it is estimated by the Corporation that the fee will exceed the dollar limit specified in the request, the Corporation will notify the requester of the estimated fee promptly upon receipt of the request. The request will not be deemed to have been received until the Corporation receives a reply from the requester stating its willingness to pay the estimated fee.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Uniform fee schedule.</E> Fees will be charged in accordance with the category of the requester and as specified below. All photocopying costs will be assessed at the rate of $0.15 per page.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> “Commercial use requesters,” as that term is defined in § 706.13 of this part, will be charged the direct cost of all time spent searching for and reviewing for release the records requested. Search costs are $13 per hour. Review costs are $33 per hour. Search and review costs will be assessed even though no records may be found or, after review, there is no disclosure of records. All pages photocopied will be assessed at the rate set out above.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.</E> The Corporation will provide records to “educational institutions” or “non-commercial scientific institutions,” as those terms are defined in § 706.13 (b)(7) and (b)(9) of this part, for the cost of reproduction alone. No fee will be charged for the costs of photocopying the first 100 pages of documents encompassed by a request. The fee for all pages photocopied will be assessed at the rate set out above. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying “educational institution” or “non-commercial scientific institution” and that the records are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Representatives of the news media.</E> The Corporation shall provide records to “representatives of the news media,” as that term is defined in § 706.13(b)(10) of this part, for the cost of reproduction alone. No fee will be charged for the costs of photocopying the first 100 pages of documents encompassed by a request. The fee for all pages photocopied will be assessed at the rate set forth above. To be eligible for inclusion in this category a requester must be a “representative of the news media” and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to <PRTPAGE P="363"/>be a request that is for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> The Corporation will provide documents to requesters who do not fit into any of the categories in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section for the cost of any search time in excess of two hours and for photocopying any documents in excess of 100 pages. The fee for search time will be assessed at the rate set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The fee for all pages photocopied will be assessed at the rate set forth above.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Non-payment of fees.</E> (1) The Corporation will begin assessing interest charges on the 31st day following the day on which the requester is advised of the fee charged, such interest charges to accrue as of the date of such notification. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>
            <P>(2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e. within 30 days of the billing date), the Corporation will require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Corporation begins to process a new request or a pending request from the requester.</P>
            <P>(3) When the Corporation acts under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the Act (i.e. 10 working days from receipt of initial request and 20 working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after the Corporation has received fee payments described above.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> Where the Corporation estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250 the Corporation will require a requester to make an advance payment of the entire fee before continuing to process the request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiving or reducing fee.</E> (1) In accordance with section (4)(A)(ii) of the Act the Corporation will furnish documents without charge or at reduced charges if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining whether disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, the Corporation will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(A) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;</P>
            <P>(B) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
            <P>(C) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding; and</P>
            <P>(D) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities.</P>
            <P>(ii) In determining whether disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Corporation will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(A) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so</P>
            <P>(B) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(2) The requester in all cases has the burden of presenting sufficient evidence or information to justify the requester waiver or reduction.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Restrictions on assessing fees.</E> With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, section (4)(A)(iv) of the Act, as amended, requires agencies to provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first <PRTPAGE P="364"/>two hours of search time without charge. Moreover, this section prohibits agencies from charging fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. These provisions work together so that, except for commercial use requesters, the Corporation will not begin to assess fees until after providing the free search and reproduction. For example, for a request that involved two hours and ten minutes of search time and resulted in 105 pages of documents, the agency will determine the cost of only 10 minutes of search time and only five pages of reproduction. If this cost is equal to or less than the cost of processing the fee collected, there will be no charge to the requester.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Documents made available free of charge.</E> No fee will be charged to any requester for any brochure or annual report readily available from the Office of Public Affairs pursuant to § 706.21(b).</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> Persons may inspect and copy in the Corporation's facilities specifically requested documents other than those which are not generally available under § 706.22 or exempt by law without charge except for search, duplication, tabulation, or compilation fees which may be otherwise payable.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Other provisions—</E> (1) <E T="03">Charges for unsuccessful search.</E> The Corporation will assess charges for time spent searching, even if the Corporation fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Aggregating requesters.</E> When the Corporation reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Corporation will aggregate any such requesters and charge accordingly.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365).</E> The Corporation will use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Remittances.</E> (i) All payments under this section shall be in the form of a personal check, bank draft drawn on a bank located in the United States, or cash. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of United States Treasury and mail to the Director of Public Affairs, Office of Corporate Communications, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, 1615 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20527. The Corporation will assume no responsibility for cash which is lost in the mail.</P>
            <P>(ii) A receipt for fees paid will be given only upon request.</P>
            <P>(iii) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this section will amount to more than $25, and the requester has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the requester will be promptly notified of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. In appropriate cases an advance deposit may be required. The requester is at any time welcome to confer with the Director of Public Affairs in order to formulate the request in a manner which will reduce the fee and meet the needs of the requester. A request will not be deemed to have been received until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipated fees and has made an advance deposit if one is required.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notification to submitters of business information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Director for Public Affairs will promptly notify a “business submitter” (as that term is defined in § 706.13(b)(3) of this part) that a request for disclosure has been made for any “business information” (as that term is defined in Section 706(b)(2) of this part) provided by such submitter, and shall describe the nature and scope of the request and advise such submitter of its right to submit written objections in response to the request. Such notice of intent to disclose shall be made to the submitter in writing and shall state the intent of the Corporation to disclose the business information on the expiration of 10 working days from the receipt of the notice.</P>
            <P>(b) The business submitter may, within 10 working days of the forwarding of the Corporation's notification under paragraph (a) of this section, submit to the attention of the Director for Public Affairs, with copy to FOIA Counsel, written objection to the disclosure of the information requested, specifying the grounds upon which it is contended that the information should not be disclosed. In setting forth such grounds, the submitter shall specify to the maximum extent feasible the basis of its belief that the nondisclosure of any item of information requested is mandated or permitted by law. In the case of information which the submitter believes to be exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4) of the Act, the submitter shall demonstrate why the information is considered a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information provided by a business submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the Act. The 10 working day period for providing the Corporation with a statement objecting to the disclosure of information encompassed by an FOIA request may be extended by the Corporation upon receipt of a written request for an extension. Such written request shall set forth the date which the statement is expected to be completed and shall provide reasonable justification for the extension. The Corporation's approval of a request for an extension shall not be unreasonably withheld.</P>
            <P>(c) The Corporation will not ordinarily notify the submitter pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section if:</P>
            <P>(1) The Corporation determines, prior to giving such notice, that the request should be denied;</P>
            <P>(2) The disclosure is required by law (other than pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552); or</P>
            <P>(3) The information has been published or otherwise made available to the public, including material described in § 706.21.</P>

            <P>(d) The Corporation shall carefully consider the objections of the submitter made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and shall promptly notify <PRTPAGE P="366"/>the submitter of any final determination regarding the release of the information requested.</P>

            <P>(b) Any request under this part 707 for notification of, access to or copies of records maintained by the Corporation shall comply with the following requirements:</P>

            <P>(d) In the event that the Director of Personnel and Administration shall decline any request submitted to the Corporation under paragraph (b) of this section because he determines under paragraph (c) of this section that the individual has not provded adequate evidence to verify his identity, said individual may, within thirty (30) days of the date of the notification thereof by the Director of Personnel and Administration, file a written appeal of such determination with the Executive Vice President of the Corporation.

Such appeal may be supported by any additional written evidence and statements deemed appropriate by the individual.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and applicability.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of the Government in the Sunshine Act. This part applies to the deliberations of a quorum of the Directors of the Corporation required to take action on behalf of the Corporation where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official Corporation business, but does not apply to deliberations to take action to open or close a meeting or to release or withhold information under § 708.5. Any deliberation to which this part applies is hereinafter in this part referred to as a meeting of the Board of Directors.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 708.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Open meeting policy.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) It is the policy of the Corporation to provide the public with the fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking process of the Board of Directors of the Corporation while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the Corporation to carry out its responsibilities. In order to effect this policy, every meeting of the Board of Directors shall be open to public observation and will only be closed to public observation if justified under one of the provisions of § 708.5. The public is invited to observe and listen to all meetings of the Board of Directors, or portions thereof, open to public observation, but may not participate or record any of the discussions by means of electronic or other devices or cameras. Documents being considered at meetings of the Board of Directors may be obtained subject to the procedures and exemptions set forth in part 706 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(b) Directors of the Corporation shall not jointly conduct or dispose of agency business other than in accordance with this part. This prohibition shall not prevent Directors from considering individually business that is circulated to them sequentially in writing.</P>
          <P>(c) The Secretary of the Corporation shall be responsible for assuring that ample space, sufficient visibility, and adequate acoustics are provided for public observation of meetings of the Board of Directors.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Scheduling of a meeting.</SUBJECT>

          <P>A decision to hold a meeting of the Board of Directors should be made as provided in the By-laws of the Corporation and at least eight days prior to the scheduled meeting date in order for the Secretary of the Corporation to give the public notice required by § 708.4. However in special cases, a majority of the Directors may decide to hold a meeting less than eight days prior to the scheduled meeting date if they determine by a recorded vote that Corporation business requires such meeting at such earlier date. After <PRTPAGE P="370"/>public announcement of a meeting of the Board of Directors under the provisions of § 708.4, the subject matter thereof, or the determination to open or close a meeting, or portion thereof, may only be changed if a majority of the Directors determines by a recorded vote that business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change is possible.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Public announcement.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of § 708.5, in the case of each meeting of the Board of Directors, the Secretary shall make public announcement at least one week before the meeting, of the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and telephone number of the official designated by the Corporation to respond to requests for information about the meeting. Such announcement shall be made unless a majority of the Directors determines by a recorded vote that Corporation business requires that such meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case the Secretary shall make public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of such meeting, and whether open or closed to the public, at the earliest practicable time.</P>
          <P>(b) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section only if the Secretary publicly announces such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Corporation to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed following the public announcement required by this section only if (1) a majority of the Directors determines by a recorded vote that business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and (2) the Secretary publicly announces such change and the vote of each Director upon such change at the earliest practicable time.</P>
          <P>(c) The <E T="03">earliest practicable time</E>, as used in this subsection, means as soon as possible, which should in few, if any, instances be later than the commencement of the meeting or portion in question.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Closed meetings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Meetings of the Board of Directors will be closed to public observation where the Corporation properly determines, according to the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, that such portion or portions of the meeting or disclosure of such information is likely to:</P>
          <P>(1) Disclose matters that are (i) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy and are (ii) in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</P>
          <P>(2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</P>

          <P>(3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552), <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such statute (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>

          <P>(4) Disclose the trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; <PRTPAGE P="371"/>
          </P>
          <P>(5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;</P>
          <P>(6) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
          <P>(7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would (i) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, (v) disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;</P>
          <P>(8) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action, except in any instance where the Corporation has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Corporation is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final Corporation action on such proposal; or</P>
          <P>(9) Specifically concern the Corporation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Corporation of a particular case of formal Corporation adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.</P>
          <P>(b) Meetings of the Board of Directors shall not be closed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section when the Corporation finds that the public interest requires that they be open.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) Action to close a meeting, or portion thereof, pursuant to the exemptions defined in paragraph (a) of this section may be initiated by the President or any Director of the Corporation by presentation of a request for closure to the Board of Directors. The person initiating the request for closure shall give the Board of Directors a statement specifying the extent of the proposed closure, the relevant exemptive provisions and the circumstances pertinent to such request, and how the public interest will be served by closure. Such statement shall also be given to the General Counsel of the Corporation to serve as a basis for the certification the General Counsel may determine can be issued in accordance with § 708.6. The General Counsel's determination shall be given to the Board of Directors. Action to close a meeting, or portion thereof, shall be taken only when a majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors votes to take such action. A separate vote of the Board of Directors shall be taken with respect to each meeting of the Board of Directors a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Director participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.</P>

          <P>(2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Corporation close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (a)(5), (a)(6), or (a)(7) of this section, the Corporation, upon request of any one of its Directors, shall <PRTPAGE P="372"/>vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting.</P>
          <P>(3) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Secretary shall, by the close of the business day next succeeding the day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, make publicly available a full written explanation of the Corporation's action closing the portion together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation. The information required by this subparagraph shall be disclosed except to the extent that it is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 708.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Records of closed meetings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) For every meeting of the Board of Directors closed pursuant to § 708.5, the General Counsel of the Corporation shall publicly certify prior to such meeting that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the Secretary as part of the transcript, recording, or minutes required by paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) The Secretary shall maintain a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, except that in the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to § 708.5(a)(9), the Secretary shall maintain either such a transcript or recording, or a set of minutes. Such minutes shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll-call vote (reflecting the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any Corporation action shall be identified in such minutes.</P>
          <P>(c) The Secretary shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of the proceeding of the Board of Directors with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.</P>
          <P>(d) Within ten days of receipt of a request for information (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), the Corporation shall make available to the public, in the Office of Secretary of the Corporation, Washington, DC, the transcript, electronic recording, or minutes (as required by paragraph (b) of this section) of the discussion of any item on the agenda, or of any item of the testimony of any witness received at the meeting, except for such item or items of such discussion or testimony as the Secretary determines to contain information which may be withheld under the provisions of § 708.5. Copies of such transcript, or minutes, or a transcription of such recording disclosing the identify of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription.</P>
          <P>(e) The determination of the Secretary to withhold information pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section may be appealed to the President of the Corporation, in his or her capacity as administrative head of the Corporation. The President will make a determination to withhold or release the requested information within twenty days from the date of receipt of the request for review (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).</P>

          <P>(a) These regulations are issued under the general powers of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (“OPIC”) and pursuant to section 237(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, added by Pub. L. 95-268.<E T="21">1 </E>

            </P>
            <P>(1) No payment may be made under any insurance or reinsurance which is issued under this title on or after the date of enactment of this subsection for any loss occurring with respect to a project, if the preponderant cause of such loss was an act by the investor seeking payment under this title, by a person possessing majority ownership and control of the investor at the time of the act, or by any agent of such investor or controlling person, and a court of the United States has entered a final judgment that such act constituted a violation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.</P>
            <P>(2) Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Corporation shall adopt regulations setting forth appropriate conditions under which any person convicted under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 for an offense related to a project insured or otherwise supported by the Corporation shall be suspended, for a period of not more than 5 years, from eligibility to receive any insurance, reinsurance, guaranty, loan or other financial support authorized by this title.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>(b) These regulations prescribe the procedure under which individuals and companies may be suspended, as mandated by section 237(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, from eligibility for OPIC services because of conviction under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-213) of an offense related to an OPIC-supported project.</P>
          <P>(c) The purposes of the suspensions provided herein are to carry out the statutory requirements of Section 237(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to protect the interest of the United States and to foster full and free competition in international commerce.</P>
          <P>(d) The specific provisions of law under which OPIC operates and the general powers conferred on OPIC give OPIC broad discretion in the conduct of its programs. The issuance of these regulations is not to be construed as in any way limiting or derogating from the discretion of OPIC to determine whether or not to support the investment of a particular entity in a particular case.</P>

          <P>Any entity which has been convicted of an offense related to a project insured or otherwise supported by OPIC may be suspended from eligibility for additional OPIC services for a period of <PRTPAGE P="374"/>not more than 5 years pursuant to a suspension determination.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 709.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedure.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Upon receipt of an application for OPIC services from any entity which OPIC has reason to believe may have been convicted under the Act the OPIC General Counsel shall ascertain whether a conviction has been entered against such entity under the Act and, if so, whether it was entered for an offense related to a project insured or otherwise supported by OPIC. If such an offense is found, the General Counsel shall advise the President of such finding and any known circumstances indicating that suspension would not be in the national interest of the United States. If, after reviewing the submission from the General Counsel, the President determines that national interest considerations are not great enough to preclude suspension, OPIC shall furnish the subject entity with a written notice (1) specifying the offense and stating that suspension for the maximum duration is being considered and (2) inviting the subject entity to submit to OPIC any evidence of facts or circumstances which it deems appropriate to indicate that a suspension should not be imposed or that the duration of the suspension should be less than the maximum. Such notice shall further state that the subject entity must provide such evidence within 30 days of the date of such written notice or any extension of time granted in writing by OPIC. The Genral Counsel shall promptly review any evidence submitted by the subject entity and report his findings and recommendations to the President. The President shall determine whether the subject entity shall be suspended and, if so, the President shall issue a suspension determination specifying the duration of such suspension. Notice of such suspension determination shall be forwarded by registered mail to the subject entity and any entity so notified shall be advised that such suspension may be reduced as provided in section 5(b) or voided as provided in section 8.</P>
          <P>(b) The duration of any suspension may be reduced by the President at any time for good cause, including the submission by the suspended entity of an application for relief, supported by evidence and setting forth appropriate grounds for granting such relief, such as the institution of measures designed to preclude the recurrence of the actions with respect to which the suspension was initially imposed. Notice of each such reduction shall be forwarded to the suspended entity by registered mail.</P>
          <P>(c) The duration of any suspension may be increased by the President at any time for good cause, subject to providing the subject entity with notice and opportunity to submit evidence in accordance with section 5(a). In no event shall any such increase result in a period of suspension exceeding 5 years with respect to any single conviction.</P>

          <P>Factors which the President may consider in setting or amending the duration of any suspension imposed pursuant to these regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
          <P>(a) Whether the offense with respect to which suspension has been imposed or is being considered was committed with the knowledge or consent of the board of directors or other group or officer or individual responsible for the overall management of the subject entity;</P>
          <P>(b) Whether or not such offense was committed under pressure of extortion, political intervention, or other duress exerted by the government, or any official of the government, of the country in which such offense was committed;</P>
          <P>(c) Quantitative factors relating to the seriousness of the offense, such as the amounts of any improper payments and the frequency with which, and period of time over which, they were made;</P>
          <P>(d) The purpose of any such offense;</P>
          <P>(e) Whether such offense violated the laws of the country in which it was committed;</P>
          <P>(f) The extent to which the offense was related to the establishment or operation of a project supported by OPIC; and</P>

          <P>(g) Any factors relating to the effect of suspension on the national interest of the United States.<PRTPAGE P="375"/>

          <P>(b) Suspended entities:</P>
          <P>(1) May be retained on the OPIC mailing list only for the purpose of receiving informational mailings;</P>
          <P>(2) May register projects with OPIC but may not submit project applications to OPIC;</P>
          <P>(3) May continue to deal with OPIC with respect to agreements entered with OPIC prior to the suspension and may amend or be granted modifications of such agreements, including loan reschedulings and refinancings;</P>
          <P>(4) May not be invited to participate in OPIC-sponsored investment missions or other similar activities; and</P>
          <P>(5) May not receive indirectly, or beneficially, whether through the purchase of project participations, the use of intermediary entities or other such devices, any OPIC services which they would not be entitled to receive directly, and may not be the beneficiary of financial support advanced by a third party where such support, in turn, is guaranteed or insured by OPIC; provided, however that such suspended entity shall be entitled to all benefits and payments accruing to holders of negotiable instruments guaranteed by OPIC and acquired by such suspended entity pursuant to a public offering thereof by the original or any subsequent holder thereof.</P>

          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 711.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 711.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 711.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be <PRTPAGE P="382"/>undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Communications.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>

          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>

          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 711.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not <PRTPAGE P="383"/>result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>(e) All disclosure forms, but not certifications, shall be forwarded from tier to tier until received by the person referred to in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. That person shall forward all disclosure forms to the agency.</P>
            <P>(f) Any certification or disclosure form filed under paragraph (e) of this section shall be treated as a material representation of fact upon which all receiving tiers shall rely. All liability arising from an erroneous representation shall be borne solely by the tier filing that representation and shall not be shared by any tier to which the erroneous representation is forwarded. Submitting an erroneous certification or disclosure constitutes a failure to file the required certification or disclosure, respectively. If a person fails to file a required certification or disclosure, the United States may pursue all available remedies, including those authorized by section 1352, title 31, U.S. Code.</P>

However, for awards and commitments in process prior to the December 23, 1989 effective date of these provisions, but not made before December 23, 1989, disclosure forms shall not be required at time of award or commitment but shall be filed within 30 days.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 712.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not <PRTPAGE P="388"/>allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 712.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 712.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable.

            <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.</P>
            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
            <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 903.4</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Participation of exclusive representative.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Upon the initiation of a case, the executive secretary shall ascertain from the Agency, the grievant/charged employee and any labor organization which has been certified as the exclusive representative of employees of the Agency, whether the relevant position occupied by the grievant/charged employee is part of the bargaining unit for which the labor organization is the exclusive representative. If a substantial dispute exists as to whether that position is part of the bargaining unit, and if the Board determines that resolution of that dispute is necessary for determining the status of the labor organization in a case, the Board shall notify the parties and the labor organization, who may request the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board to make a final determination of that dispute. If the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board determines that the grievant or charged employee is a member of a bargaining unit represented by an exclusive representative, the executive secretary shall promptly send a copy of the papers filed with the Board to the exclusive representative.</P>
        <P>(b) The exclusive representative has the right to intervene as a party to the case if such exclusive representative gives timely notice to the Board in writing of its decision to intervene as a party. Notice shall be considered to be timely if given prior to or at the prehearing conference, or, in a case to be decided under part 907 of this chapter, if given within 10 days of receipt of a notice from the Board of the Board's intent to close the record of proceedings.</P>
        <P>(c) An exclusive representative which has not intervened under paragraph (b) of this section may be permitted to intervene as a party upon written application. In ruling upon the application, the Board shall consider whether granting the application will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties, and may place conditions on the exclusive representative's participation to avoid such delay or prejudice.</P>

        <P>(b) In considering a case, the Board shall have access to any Agency record as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) the Board shall request access to any Agency record which the grievant/charged employee requests to substantiate his or her grievance or defense to a charge if the Board determines that such record may be relevant and material to the case.</P>
        <P>(2) the Board may request access to any other Agency record which the Board determines may be relevant and material to the case.</P>
        <P>(3) An Agency shall make available to the Board any Agency record requested under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section unless the head or deputy head or such Agency personally certifies in writing to the Board that disclosure of the record to the Board and the parties would adversely affect the foreign policy or national security of the United States or that such disclosure is prohibited by law. If such a certification is made with respect to any record, the Agency shall supply to the Board a summary or extract of such record unless the reasons specified in the preceding sentence preclude such a summary or extract.</P>
        <P>(c) If the Board determines that an Agency record, or a summary or extract of a record, made available to the Board under paragraph (b) of this section is relevant and material to the case, the Agency concerned shall make such record, summary, or extract, as the case may be, available to the parties.</P>
        <P>(d) In considering a case, the Board may take into account the fact that the parties or the Board were denied access to any Agency record which the Board determines is or may be relevant and material to the case.</P>

It shall be the responsibility of the grievant to advise the agency of the agency witnesses to be interviewed and to request administrative leave.</P>

        <P>(a) If an Agency, in its final review, has questioned whether a complaint constitutes a grievance, the Board will make a preliminary determination of its jurisdiction unless the Board concludes that resolution of the question of jurisdiction should be deferred until the Board has compiled a record of proceedings or held a hearing on the merits of the case.</P>

Notwithstanding such suspension of action, the head of the agency concerned or a chief of mission or principal officer may exclude the Grievant from official premises or from the performance of specified functions when such exclusion is determined in writing to be essential to the functioning of the post or office to which the Grievant is assigned.</P>

        <P>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall not determine that action to suspend without pay a Grievant shall be suspended if the head of an agency or his designee has determined that there is reasonable cause to believe that a Grievant has committed a job-related crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and has taken action to suspend the Grievant without pay pending a final resolution of the underlying matter. For this purpose, reasonable cause to believe that a member has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed shall be defined as a member of the Service having been convicted of, and sentence of imprisonment having been imposed for a job-related crime.<PRTPAGE P="402"/>

        <P>(a) If the Board finds that the grievance is meritorious and that remedial action should be taken that relates directly to promotion, tenure, or assignment of the Grievant or to other remedial action not otherwise provided for in this section, or if the Board finds that the evidence in a grievance proceeding warrants disciplinary action against any employee of an Agency, it shall make an appropriate recommendation to the head of the concerned Agency.</P>
        <P>(b) The head of the Agency shall make a written decision on the recommendation of the Board within 30 days after receiving the recommendation and shall implement the recommendation of the Board except to the extent that the head of the Agency rejects the recommendation in whole or in part on the basis of a determination that implementation of the recommendation would be contrary to law or would adversely affect the foreign policy or national security of the United States. If the head of the Agency rejects the recommendation in whole or in part, the decision shall specify the reasons for such action. Copies of the decision shall be served on the other parties. Pending the decision of the head of the Agency, there shall be no ex parte communication concerning the grievance between the head of the Agency and any person involved in the proceedings of the Board. The head of the Agency shall, however, have access to the entire Record of the Proceedings of the Board.</P>
        <P>(c) A recommendation under this section shall, for the purposes of section 1110 of the Act, be considered a final action upon the expiration of a 30-day period referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, except to the extent that it is rejected by the head of the Agency by an appropriate written decision.</P>
        <P>(d)(1) If the head of the Agency makes a written decision under paragraph (b) of this section rejecting a recommendation in whole or in part on the basis of a determination that implementing such recommendation would be contrary to law, the head of the Agency shall, within the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
        <P>(i) Submit a copy of such decision to the Board; and<PRTPAGE P="406"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) Request that the Board reconsider its recommendation or, if less than the entirety is rejected, that the Board reconsider the portion rejected.</P>
        <P>(2) Within 30 days after receiving such a request, the Board shall, after reviewing the head of the Agency's decision, make a recommendation to the head of the agency confirming, modifying, or vacating its original recommendation or, if less than the entirety was rejected, the portion involved. Reconsideration shall be limited to the question of whether implementing the Board's original recommendation, either in whole or in part, as applicable, would be contrary to law.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Access to records.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided by law or regulation any individual upon request may gain access to his or her record or to any information pertaining to him or her which is contained in any system or records maintained by the Inter-American Foundation. The individual will be permitted, and upon his or her request, a person of his or her own choosing permitted to accompany him or her, to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him or her. The Inter-American foundation will require, however, a written statement from the individual authorizing discussion of that individual's record in the accompanying person's presence.</P>
        <P>(b) Any individual may request amendment of any Inter-American Foundation record pertaining to him or her. Not later than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of such request, the Inter-American Foundation will acknowledge in writing such receipt. The Inter-American Foundation will also promptly either:</P>
        <P>(1) Correct any part thereof which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete; or</P>
        <P>(2) Inform the individual of the Inter-American Foundation's refusal to amend the record in accordance with his or her request, the reason for the refusal, the procedures by which the individual may request a review of that refusal by the Administrator or designee, and the name and address of such official.</P>

        <P>(c) Any individual who disagrees with the Inter-American Foundation's refusal to amend his or her record may request a review of such refusal. The Inter-American Foundation will complete such review not later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date on which the individual requests such review and make a final determination unless, for good cause shown, the Administrator extends such 30-day period. If, after review, the Administrator or designee also refuses to amend the record in accordance with the request the individual will be advised of the right to file with the Inter-American Foundation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the Inter-American Foundation's refusal, and <PRTPAGE P="415"/>also advised of the provisions for judicial review of the reviewing official's determination (5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A)).</P>
        <P>(d) In any disclosure, containing information about which the individual has filed a statement of disagreement, occurring after the filing of the statement under paragraph (c) of this section, the Inter-American Foundation will clearly note any part of the record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement (and, if the Inter-American Foundation deems it appropriate, copies also of a concise statement of the Inter-American Foundation's reasons for not making the amendments requested) to persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record has been disclosed.</P>
        <P>(e) Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a, however, allows an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>

The Inter-American Foundation is a government corporation headed by a 7-member Board of Directors, all of whom are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is therefore an “agency” under these terms.</P>

        <P>(g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:</P>
        <P>(1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,</P>
        <P>(2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial of an impartial adjudication,</P>
        <P>(3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</P>
        <P>(4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential source,</P>

        <P>(6) Endanger the life of physical safety of law enforcement personnel;</P>
        <P>(h) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly guarantee implementation of a proposed agency action.

That vote shall determine whether or not any portion or portions of a meeting or portions of a series of meetings may be closed to public observation for any of the reasons provided in § 1004.4 and whether or not the public interest nevertheless requires that portion of the meeting or meetings remain <PRTPAGE P="420"/>open. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Board member participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.</P>
        <P>(2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the IAF close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in § 1004.4 (e), (f) or (g), the IAF, upon request of any one of its Board members, shall take a recorded vote, whether to close such portion of the meeting.</P>
        <P>(b) Within one day of any vote taken, the IAF shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question and full written explanation of its action closing the entire or portion of the meeting together with a list of persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</P>
        <P>(c) The IAF shall announce the time, place and subject matter of the meeting at least 8 days before the meeting.</P>
        <P>(d) For every closed meeting, the General Counsel of the IAF shall publicly certify prior to a Board of Directors’ vote on closing the meeting, that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the IAF.</P>

        <P>The time or place of a Board meeting may be changed following the public announcement only if the IAF publicly announces such change at the earilest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the agency to open or close a meeting, or portion of meeting, to the public, may be changed following the public announcement only if a majority of the Board of Directors determines by a recorded vote that IAF business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and the IAF publicly announces such change and the vote of each member upon such change at the earliest practicable time.</P>

Copies of such transcript, or a transcription of such recording disclosing the identity of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription. The IAF shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any IAF proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.</P>

        <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1005.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 1005.150</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
        <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
        <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
        <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1005.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods—</E>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1005.150(a) in historic preservation <PRTPAGE P="425"/>programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1005.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
        <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
        <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
        <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
        <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
        <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
        <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

        <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
        <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
        <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
        <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
        <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
        <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>

        <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can <PRTPAGE P="426"/>demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1005.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.</P>

          <P>(b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the guidelines <PRTPAGE P="428"/>promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under section 6 of the E.O. by:</P>
          <P>(1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the governmentwide system;</P>
          <P>(2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;</P>
          <P>(3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of “ineligible” in § 1006.105), and participants who have voluntarily excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;</P>
          <P>(4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and</P>
          <P>(5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.</P>
          <P>(c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by—</P>
          <P>(1) Providing for the inclusion in the <E T="03">List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs</E> all persons proposed for debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons determined to be ineligible; and</P>
          <P>(2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.</P>
          <P>(d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Coverage.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of these regulations such transactions will be referred to as “covered transactions.”</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Covered transaction.</E> For purposes of these regulations, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Primary covered transaction.</E> Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: Grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lower tier covered transaction.</E> A lower tier covered transaction is:</P>
          <P>(A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a primary covered transaction.</P>
          <P>(B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary covered transaction.</P>
          <P>(C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Principal investigators.</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Providers of federally-required audit services.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The following transactions are not covered:</P>
          <P>(i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;</P>
          <P>(ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;</P>
          <P>(iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);</P>
          <P>(iv) Federal employment;</P>
          <P>(v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters;</P>
          <P>(vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and</P>
          <P>(vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations would be prohibited by law.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Relationship to other sections.</E> This section describes the types of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations will apply. Subpart B, “Effect of Action,” § 1006.200, “Debarment or suspension,” sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities described in § 1006.110(a). Sections 1006.325, “Scope of debarment,” and 1006.420, “Scope of suspension,” govern <PRTPAGE P="431"/>the extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a participant would be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Relationship to Federal procurement activities.</E> In accordance with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or suspension under the FAR.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are appropriate means to implement this policy.</P>
          <P>(b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in these regulations.</P>
          <P>(c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Period of debarment.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment period.</P>
          <P>(1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of the requirements of subpart F of this part generally should not exceed three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment may be imposed.</P>

          <P>(2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements of subpart F of this part (<E T="03">see</E> § 1006.305(c)(5)), the period of debarment shall not exceed five years.</P>
          <P>(b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an additional period, if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest.</P>
          <P>However, a debarment may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of §§ 1006.311 through 1006.314 shall be followed to extend the debarment.</P>
          <P>(c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but not limited to:</P>
          <P>(1) Newly discovered material evidence;</P>
          <P>(2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the debarment was based;</P>

          <P>(a)(1) As a prior condition of being awarded a grant, each grantee shall make the appropriate certification to the Federal agency providing the grant, as provided in appendix C to this part.</P>

          <P>(2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-automatic continuation of <PRTPAGE P="441"/>such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.</P>
          <P>(b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the required certification for each grant. For mandatory formula grants and entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.</P>
          <P>(c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this statewide certification in its Governor's office and, prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central location for submission.</P>
          <P>(d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.</P>
          <P>(2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central location for submission.</P>
          <P>(3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those located in other State agencies.</P>
          <P>(e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which performance is expected to be completed.</P>
          <P>(2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days after award.</P>
          <P>(3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy statement and program shall be in place.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:</P>
          <P>(1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.</P>
          <P>(2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was convicted.</P>
          <P>(i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.</P>

          <P>(b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant activity shall <PRTPAGE P="442"/>report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notices. Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.</P>

          <P>1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary participant is providing the certification set out below.</P>
          <P>2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person from participation in this transaction.</P>
          <P>3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default.</P>
          <P>4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</P>

          <P>8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.</P>
          <P>9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</P>
          <P>10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default.</P>

To accord with these concepts, the order sets forth the section's regulations prescribing standards of conduct and responsibilities and governing statements of employment and financial interests for employees and special Government employees.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1100.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In Executive Order 11222 prescribing standards of ethical conduct for Government officers and employees, the President asserted the following policy: Where Government is based on the consent of the governed, every citizen is entitled to have complete confidence in the integrity of his government. Each individual officer, employee, or advisor of government must help to earn and must honor that trust by his own integrity and conduct in all official actions.</P>
          <P>(b) This order sets forth the rules and regulations adopted by the Section in response to Executive Order 11222 and implements chapter 735 of the Federal Personnel Manual. It is the obligation of every employee to be thoroughly familiar with the requirements herein and it is further the responsibility of each supervisor to assure complete understanding by employees in his organization.</P>
          <P>(c) Any information which indicates that an employee may have violated the provisions of this Order should be forwarded through channels by the employee's supervisors. It should be sent to the supervisory official who, under current instructions, is authorized to take appropriate remedial or disciplinary action. Such action should be taken at the lowest practicable supervisory level in order that if necessary, reviews may be made at a higher level of supervision. The official to whom information is addressed will make a thorough investigation of the matter and take appropriate action. The Personnel Director, or designated representative, will be consulted to insure that proposed actions are proper and in accordance with applicable laws, Civil Service Commission regulations, and Section requirements. When official information is involved, the official investigating the matter will insure that such information is protected in accordance with applicable regulations.</P>
          <P>(d) Additionally, if the complaint or information alleges the acceptance of gifts or favors, or the use of official position for personal advantage, notice of the complaint or information shall be furnished immediately to the Commissioner. Cases arising in the field shall be routed through the Executive Officer.</P>
          <P>(e) If the complaint or information originates within the Section, necessary investigation and/or remedial action shall be initiated concurrently with the submission of notice to the Commissioner. Letters or complaints from outside the Section will accompany the notice to the Commissioner, who will determine and direct the action to be taken on them.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial information.</E> At the time they are published or revised, each employee will be furnished a copy of the Section's regulations governing employee responsibilities and conduct. Further, the Personnel Director shall establish procedures to insure that employees are periodically reminded of these rules and regulations, at least annually.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Counseling service.</E> A counseling service is available to provide advice and guidance to individual employees concerning their responsibilities under the Section's rules and regulations. The Personnel Director will provide guidance and advice to employees regarding the provisions of this order. For the purposes of conflict of interest laws, the Chief, Real Estate shall serve as counselor.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1100.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Each employee is responsible for acquainting him/herself <SU>3</SU>
            <FTREF/> with the standards of conduct expected of him, and to conduct himself, both on and off the job, in a manner which will insure that his actions reflect credit to the Federal Government and the Section.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>3</SU> For convenience of reading, the standard generic pronoun usage will be followed in the remainder of this Order. Where the pronoun ‘he’ is used it should be understood to include he or she; ‘him’ includes him or her; ‘his’, his or hers; ‘himself’, himself or herself.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>(b) Supervisors will keep subordinate employees informed regarding the proper standards of conduct required.

          <P>(c) The Personnel Director, or his designated representative, will provide assistance and/or counseling to employees and all levels of management in observance of regulations pertinent to conduct and/or conflict of interest.</P>
          <P>(d) The Chief, Real Estate is the main point of contact on conflicts of interest problems. The Special Legal Assistant will assist on matters of legal interpretation.</P>
          <P>(e) All employees engaged in procurement and related activities have a special responsibility for protecting the Government's interests as well as for maintaining the reputation of the Section for honesty, courtesy, and fair dealing.

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1100.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Rules of conduct.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The primary purpose of establishing rules of conduct is to provide guidance. Although the rules set forth in this Order are considered reasonable, it is recognized there will be instances in which one or more of these rules will be disregarded or violated. Provisions have therefore been made for the imposition of remedial actions designed both to correct the disregard on the part of the offenders and to serve as a caution to others.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">On-the-job conduct.</E> Each employee is expected to:</P>
          <P>(1) Report promptly for work in a condition which will permit him to perform assigned duties (i.e., in appropriate clothing, with any required tools and/or equipment, and in a sober condition).</P>
          <P>(2) Render full, efficient, and industrious service in the performance of assigned duties. If insufficient work is assigned to occupy an employee fully at any given time, he is expected to notify his supervisor so that additional work may be assigned.</P>
          <P>(3) Give ready response and enthusiasm to directions and instructions received from his supervisor.</P>
          <P>(4) Exercise courtesy and tact in dealings with fellow workers and the public.</P>
          <P>(5) Maintain a clean and neat personal appearance to the maximum practicable extent during working hours.</P>
          <P>(6) Conserve and protect Federal funds, property, equipment, and materials.</P>

          <P>(7) Observe the various laws, rules, regulations, and other authoritative instructions, and consistently conduct <PRTPAGE P="455"/>himself in a manner which is beyond reproach.</P>
          <P>(8) Recognize his responsibility for taking an active part in the Section affairs.</P>
          <P>(9) Uphold with integrity the public trust involved in the position to which assigned.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Off-the-job conduct.</E> While the Section does not desire to interfere unnecessarily in the private lives of its employees, it does expect them to conduct themselves at all times in a manner which will not reflect unfavorably upon the Federal Government as their employer.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1100.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Conflict of interest.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) All Section employees are bound to refrain from any private business or professional activity which would place them in a position where there is a conflict between their private interests and the public interests of the United States. Even though a technical conflict of interest may not exist, employees must avoid the appearance of such a conflict from a public confidence point of view. (chapter 11 of title 18 of the U.S. Code, enacted by Pub. L. 878-849, effective January 21, 1963, constitutes the basic conflict of interest statutes.)</P>

          <P>(a) Section employees will not engage in outside employment or other outside activities, with or without compensation, which—</P>
          <P>(1) Interferes with the performance of their Government duties;</P>
          <P>(2) May reasonably be expected to bring discredit upon the Section or the Government; or</P>
          <P>(3) Appears to involve a conflict of interest.</P>
          <P>(b) All employees are prohibited from using their titles or positions in connection with any commercial enterprise or in endorsing any commercial product or venture.</P>
          <P>(c) Section employees engaged in activities related to procurement will not accept part-time off-duty employment with any person that is a contractor with the Government. This prohibition applies regardless of the nature of the services to be performed. (e.g., Professional employees of the Section such as attorneys, engineers, and accountants will not represent or advise a Government contractor concerning either the commercial or Government pursuits of such person; nor will such personnel render services in behalf of the officers of contractors with whom they transact business on behalf of the Government, even though such services might be performed in connection with the personal affairs of such officers of the contractors.)</P>

          <P>(a) An employee shall pay each just financial obligation in a proper and timely manner, especially one imposed by law, such as Federal, State, or local taxes.

          <P>(b) When an employee has a levy placed against his salary for failure to pay an indebtedness for Federal income taxes, he shall be issued a written reprimand stating that failure to make satisfactory arrangements regarding future tax liabilities will be grounds for removal.</P>
          <P>(c) When an employee is the subject of a letter of complaint stating that he has not paid his State or local taxes and has failed to make satisfactory arrangements regarding the debt, he shall be interviewed by the Personnel Director, or his designated representative in field offices.

          <P>(d) When an employee is the subject of a letter of complaint regarding any other kind of indebtedness to a unit of government, Federal, State, or local, the procedure prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be observed.</P>

          <P>(e) When a creditor who holds a legal judgment against an employee requests that the Section assist in collecting the debt, the employee shall be interviewed by the Personnel Director, or his designated representative in field offices, as appropriate. In this interview he shall be instructed to pay the <PRTPAGE P="456"/>debt in full within 90 days, or such period of time as is acceptable to the creditor, and informed that failure to do so may be grounds for removal.</P>
          <P>(f) When an employee is the subject of a letter of complaint from a creditor who does not hold a legal judgment against the employee, the Personnel Director shall forward a copy of the letter to the employee together with a memorandum calling the employee's attention to the provisions of this order.

          <P>(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with the Section;</P>
          <P>(2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the Section; or</P>
          <P>(3) has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of his official duty.</P>

          <P>(1) Obvious family or personal relationships, such as those between the employee and his parents, children, or spouse, when the circumstances make it clear that those relationships rather than the business of the persons concerned are the motivating factors;</P>

          <P>(d) An employee shall not accept a gift, present, decoration, or other thing from a foreign government unless authorized by Congress as provided by the Constitution and in 5 U.S.C. 7342.</P>
          <P>(e) This order does not preclude an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this Order for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. However, this Order does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on his behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official business under Section orders when reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B -128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.</P>
          <P>(f) A gift or gratuity, the receipt of which is prohibited by this Order shall be returned to the donor with a written explanation why the return is necessary. A copy of the written explanation shall be submitted to the Personnel Director for filing in the employee's Official Personnel Folder (left side). When the return of the gift is not possible, the gift or gratuity shall be submitted to the Personnel Director with a written explanation why the return is not feasible. The Personnel Director shall turn the gift or gratuity over to a public or private charity or charitable organization.</P>

          </P>
          <P>(2) Engage in, directly or indirectly, a financial transaction as a result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through his Government employment.</P>

An employee may, therefore, properly make an address explaining and interpreting such a program, citing its achievements, defending it against uninformed or unjust criticism, pointing out the need for possible improvements, or soliciting views for improving it.</P>
          <P>(b) An employee shall not, either directly or indirectly, use appropriated funds to influence a Member of Congress to favor or oppose legislation in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1913. However, an employee is not prohibited from:</P>
          <P>(1) Testifying as a representative of the Section on pending legislation proposals before Congressional committees on request; or</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1100.23</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Review of position descriptions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Because of the nature of the Section's mission, establishment of a standing list of employees subject to the provisions of this subpart is considered impractical inasmuch as assignments are subject to frequent change, organizational elements change with the changing work needs, supervisors or heads of organizations are subject to change with changing conditions. It is therefore necessary that all position descriptions in § 1100.22 (b) through (d) will be reviewed and a statement as to whether the incumbent of the position must file a statement of employment and financial interests, as required by this order, will be included in each position description. This determination will be reviewed at least annually, at the time of performance ratings, or incident to other prescribed annual reviews.</P>
          <P>(b) Incumbents of positions identified as involving any of the functions described in § 1100.22 (b) through (d) will be required to comply with the filing requirements of this order. Any employee who believes that his position has been improperly included in the functions described in § 1100.22 (b) through (d), may request a review of the decision requiring him to file a statement through the established grievance procedures.</P>
          <P>(c) Positions in the above categories may be excluded when it is determined by the Commissioner that the duties are at such a level or responsibility that the submission of a statement is not necessary because of the degree of supervision and review of the incumbent and the remote and inconsequential effect on the integrity of the Section.</P>

          <P>(b) Each employee required by this Order to file a statement will do so within 30 days following entry on duty of assignment to the position and periodically thereafter as prescribed in § 1100.28.</P>
          <P>(c) Statement will be submitted to the Personnel Director in a double sealed envelope marked “For Attention of the Personnel Director Only”.</P>

          <P>If, by reason of his duty assignment, it is impracticable for an employee to submit a statement within the period required by the Order, his immediate supervisor may grant a 15-day extension of time therefor, and the supervisor will notify the Personnel Director, in writing, of the extension. Any extension in excess of 30 days requires the concurrence of the Commissioner. Statements submitted pursuant to an extension of time granted will include appropriate notation to that effect.</P>

        <SUBJECT>General policy: Collection and use of personal information.</SUBJECT>

        <P>(a) Heads of Divisions, Branches, and the projects shall ensure that all Section personnel subject to their supervision are advised of the provisions of the Act, including the criminal penalties and civil liabilities provided therein, and that Section personnel are made aware of their responsibilities to protect the security of personal information, to assure its accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness, to avoid unauthorized disclosure either orally or in writing, and to ensure that <PRTPAGE P="462"/>no system of records concerning individuals, no matter how small or specialized, is maintained without public notice.</P>

        <P>(a) The Act requires that records subject to the Act be maintained with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.</P>

        <P>(1) Areas in which the records are maintained or regularly used shall be posted with an appropriate warning stating that access to the records is limited to authorized persons. The warning shall also summarize the requirements of § 1101.3 and state that the Act contains a criminal penalty for the unauthorized dislosure of records to which it applies.</P>
        <P>(2) During working hours: (i) The area in which the records are maintained or regularly used shall be occupied by authorized personnel or (ii) access to the records shall be restricted by their storage in locked metal file cabinets or a locked room.</P>

        <P>(3) A certified or authenticated copy of documents establishing parentage or guardianship;</P>
        <P>(4) Whether the individual to whom the record pertains is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United States;</P>
        <P>(5) Name of the system of records, as published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
        <P>(6) Location of the system of records, as published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
        <P>(7) Such additional information as the individual believes will or might assist the Section in responding to the inquiry and in verifying the individual's identity (for example: date of birth, place of birth, names of parents, place of work, dates of employment, position title, etc.);</P>
        <P>(8) Date of inquiry; and</P>
        <P>(9) Signature of the requester.</P>
        <FP>The Section reserves the right to require compliance with the identification procedures appearing at paragraph (f) of this section where conditions warrant.</FP>
        <P>(f) The requirement for identification of individuals seeking access to records are as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) In person: Each individual making a request in person shall be required to present satisfactory proof of identity. The means of proof, in the order of preference and priority, are:</P>
        <P>(i) A document bearing the individual's photograph (for example, driver's license, passport or military or civilian identification card);</P>
        <P>(ii) A document bearing the individual's signature, preferably issued for participation in a federally sponsored program (for example, Social Security card, unemployment insurance book, employer's identification card, national credit card and professional, craft or union membership card); and</P>
        <P>(iii) A document bearing either the photograph or the signature of the individual, preferably issued for participation in a federally sponsored program (for example, Medicaid card). In the event the individual can provide no suitable documentation of identity, the Section will require a signed statement asserting the individual's identity and stipulating that the individual understands the penalty provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3).</P>
        <P>(2) Not in person: If the individual making a request does not appear in person before the PA Officer, a certificate of a notary public or equivalent officer empowered to administer oaths must accompany the request.</P>

        <P>(3) Parents of minors and legal guardians: An individual acting as the parent of a minor or the legal guardian of the individual or an heir or legal representative of a deceased person to whom a record pertains shall establish his or her personal identity in the manner prescribed in either paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section. In addition, such individual shall establish his or her identity in the representative capacity of parent or legal guardian. In the case of the parent of a minor, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the minor's birth certificate. In the case of a legal guardian of an individual who has been declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the court's order. A parent or legal guardian may act only for a living individual, not for a decedent. A parent or legal guardian may be accompanied during personal access to a record by another individual, provided the requirements of paragraph (f) of § 1101.7 are satisfied. In the case of an heir or legal representative of a deceased person the proof of identity shall be a certified copy of the Will, if any; the order of a court of competent jurisdiction admitting the Will to probate; the order of a court of competent jurisdiction appointing an executor, executrix, or administrator; a letter of <PRTPAGE P="465"/>administration; or any other documentary evidence which establishes the identity of the individual as an heir or legal representative of a deceased person.</P>
        <P>(g) When the provisions of this part are alleged to have the effect of impeding an individual in exercising his or her right to access, the Section will consider, from an individual making a request, alternative suggestions regarding proof of identity and access to records.</P>
        <P>(h) An inquiry which is not addressed as specified in paragraph (b) of this section or which is not marked as specified in paragraph (c) of this section will be so addressed and marked by the Section's personnel and forwarded immediately to the PA Officer. An inquiry which is not properly addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been “received” for purposes of measuring time periods for response until forwarding of the inquiry to the PA Officer has been effected. In each instance when an inquiry so forwarded is received, the PA Officer shall notify the individual that his or her inquiry was improperly addressed and the date when the inquiry was received at the proper address.</P>
        <P>(i) Each inquiry received shall be acted upon promptly by the PA Officer. Although there is no fixed time when an agency must respond to a request for access to records under the Act, every effort will be made to respond within ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the date of receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten (10) days, the PA Officer shall send an acknowledgment during that period providing information on the status of the inquiry and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the inquiry. Every effort will be made to provide the requested records within thirty (30) days.</P>
        <P>(j) An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her inquiry.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Disclosure of records to individuals who are subjects of those records.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Each request received shall be acted upon promptly by the PA Officer. Every effort will be made to respond within ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the date of receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten (10) days due to unusual circumstances, the PA Officer shall send an acknowledgment during that period providing information on the status of the request and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the request. Every effort will be made to provide the requested records within thirty (30) days. “Unusual circumstances” shall include circumstances where a search for and collection of requested records from inactive storage, field facilities or other establishments are required, cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved, instances where information on other individuals must be separated or expunged from the particular record, and cases where consultations with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request are necessary.</P>
        <P>(b) Grant of access:</P>
        <P>(1) Notification.</P>
        <P>(i) An individual shall be granted access to a record pertaining to him or her except where the record is subject to an exemption under the Act and these rules.</P>
        <P>(ii) The PA Officer shall notify the individual of such determination and provide the following information:</P>
        <P>(A) The methods of access, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
        <P>(B) The place at which the records may be inspected;</P>
        <P>(C) The earliest date on which the record may be inspected and the period of time that the records will remain available for inspection. In no event shall the earliest date be later than thirty (30) days from the date of notification;</P>
        <P>(D) The estimated date by which a copy of the record could be mailed and the estimate of fees pursuant to § 1101.11. In no event shall be estimated date be later than thirty (30) days from the date of notification;</P>

        <P>(E) The fact that the individual, if he or she wishes, may be accompanied by another individual during the personal access, subject to the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section; and<PRTPAGE P="466"/>
        </P>
        <P>(F) Any additional requirements needed to grant access to a specific record.</P>
        <P>(2) Method of access: The following methods of access to records by an individual may be available depending on the circumstances of a given situation:</P>
        <P>(i) Inspection in person may be made in the office specified by the PA Officer, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding holidays);</P>
        <P>(ii) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to the individual may be arranged, but only if the PA Officer determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's access can be properly supervised at that facility, and that transmittal of the records to that facility will not unduly interfere with operations of the section or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of both money and manpower; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Copies may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject to payment of the fees prescribed in § 1101.11. The Section, at its own initiative, may elect to provide a copy by mail, in which case no fee will be charged to the individual.</P>
        <P>(c) Access to medical records: Upon advice by a physician that release of medical information directly to the requester could have an adverse effect on the requester, the Section may attempt to arrange an acceptable alternative. This will normally involve release of such information to a physician named by the requester, with the requester's written consent. (Note that release to any third party, including a physician or family member, must comply with the provisions of § 1101.8 of this part.)</P>
        <P>(d) The Section shall supply such other information and assistance at the time of access to make the record intelligible to the individual.</P>
        <P>(e) The Section reserves the right to limit access to copies and abstracts of original records, rather than the original records. This election would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an automated data media such as tape of disc, when the record contains information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is permissible under exemptions (for example 5, U.S.C. 552(k)(1)). In no event shall original records of the Section be made available to the individual except under the immediate supervision of the PA Officer or his designee. Title 18 U.S.C. 2701(a) makes it a crime to conceal, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy a record filed in a public office, or to attempt to do any of the foregoing.</P>
        <P>(f) Any individual who request access to a record pertaining to that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her choice. “Accompanied” includes discussion of the record in the presence of the other individual. The individual to whom the record pertains shall authorize the presence of the other individual in writing and shall include the name of the other individual, a specific description of the record to which access is sought, and the date and the signature of the individual to whom the record pertains. The other individual shall sign the authorization in the presence of the PA Officer or his designee. An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her decision to be accompanied by another individual during the personal access to a record.</P>
        <P>(g) Initial denial of access:</P>
        <P>(1) Grounds. Access by an individual to a record which pertains to that individual will be denied only upon a determination by the PA Officer that:</P>
        <P>(i) The record is subject to an exemption under the Act and these rules;</P>
        <P>(ii) The record is information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding;</P>
        <P>(iii) The provisions of § 1101.7(c) pertaining to medical records have been temporarily invoked; or</P>
        <P>(iv) The individual unreasonably has failed to comply with the procedural requirements of these rules.</P>
        <P>(2) Notification. The PA Officer shall give notice of denial of access of records to the individual in writing and shall include the following information:</P>
        <P>(i) The PA Officer's name and title or position;</P>
        <P>(ii) The date of denial;</P>

        <P>(iii) The reasons for the denial, including citation to the appropriate section of the Act and these rules;<PRTPAGE P="467"/>

        <P>(3) Administrative review: When an initial denial of a request is issued by the PA Officer, the individual's opportunities for further consideration shall be as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) As to denial under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the sole procedure is a petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule under 5 U.S.C. 553(e). Such petition shall be filed with the Commissioner, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, Suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. If the exception was determined by another agency, the PA Officer will provide the individual with the name and address of the other agency and any relief sought by the individual shall be that provided by the regulations of the other agency. Within the Section, no such denial is administratively final until such a petition has been filed by the individual and disposed of on the merits by the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>(ii) As to denial under paragraphs (g)(1), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section, the individual may file for review with the Commissioner, as indicated in the PA Officer's initital denial notification.</P>
        <P>(h) If a request is partially granted and partially denied, the PA Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.</P>

        <P>(b) Whenever an individual's record is corrected or amended pursuant to a request by that individual, the PA Officer shall notify all persons and agencies to which copies of the record had been disclosed prior to its correction or amendment, if an accounting of such disclosure required by the Act was made. The notification shall require a receipt agency maintaining the record to acknowledge receipt of the notification, to correct or amend the record, and to apprise any agency or person to which it has disclosed the record of the substance of the correction or amendment.</P>
        <P>(c) The following criteria will be considered by the PA Officer in reviewing a request for correction or amendment.</P>

The processing of appeals will be facilitated if the words “PRIVACY APPEAL” appear in capital letters on both the envelope and the top of the appeal papers. An appeal not addressed and marked as provided herein will be marked by Section personnel when it is so identified and will be forwarded immediately to the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>(b) The time for decision on the appeal begins on the date the appeal is received by the Commissioner. The appeal should include any documentation, information or statements advanced for the amendment of the record.</P>
        <P>(c) There shall be a written record of the reason for the final determination. The final determination will be made not later than thirty (30) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) from the date the Commissioner receives the appeal; unless, for good cause shown, the Commissioner extends such determination beyond the thirty (30) day period.</P>
        <P>(d) When the final determination is that the record should be amended in accordance with the individual's request, the Commissioner shall direct the office responsible for the record to comply. The office responsible for the record shall:</P>
        <P>(1) Amend the record as directed;</P>
        <P>(2) If a distribution of the record has been made, advise all previous recipients of the record of the amendment and its substance;</P>
        <P>(3) So advise the individual in writing.</P>
        <P>(e) When the final decision is that the request of the individual to amend the record is refused, the Commissioner shall advise the individual:</P>
        <P>(1) Of the refusal and the reasons for it;</P>
        <P>(2) Of his or her right to file a concise statement of the reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the Section;</P>
        <P>(3) Of the procedures for filing the statement of disagreement;</P>
        <P>(4) That the statement which is filed will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with, at the discretion of the Section, a brief statement by the Section summarizing its reasons for refusing to amend the record;</P>
        <P>(5) That prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of any statement of dispute to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was maintained; and</P>
        <P>(6) Of his or her right to seek judicial review of the Section's refusal to amend the record.</P>
        <P>(f) When the final determination is to refuse to amend a record and the individual has filed a statement under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the Section will clearly annotate the record so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent to anyone who may subsequently have access to use or disclose it. When information that is the subject of a statement of dispute filed by an individual is subsequently disclosed, the Section will note that the information is disputed and provide a copy of the individual's statement. The Section may also include a brief summary of the reasons for not making a correction when disclosing disputed information. Such statements will normally be limited to the reasons given to the individual for not amending the record. Copies of the Section's statement shall be treated as part of the individual's record for granting access; however, it will not be subject to amendment by the individual under these rules.</P>
        <P>(g) An appeal will be decided on the basis of the individual's appeal papers and the record submitted by the PA officer. No personal appearance or hearings on appeals will be allowed.</P>

        <P>The purpose of this part is to prescribe rules, guidelines and procedures to implement the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended on November 21, 1974, by Public Law 93-502, and on October 27, 1986, by Public Law 99-570.</P>

          <E T="03">Act</E> means the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Commercial-use request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a cause or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Section will consider how the requester will use the documents.<PRTPAGE P="473"/>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Commissioner</E> means head of the United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures which the Section actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs incude, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility where the records are stored.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Disclose or disclosure</E> means making records available, on request for examination and copying, or furnishing a copy of records.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a document in response to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine-readable documentation. The Section will provide a copy of the material in a form that is usable by the requester unless it is administratively burdensome to do so.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is referenced above, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Person</E> or <E T="03">Requester</E> includes any individual, firm, corporation, organization or other entity.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Records</E> and/or <E T="03">information</E> are defined as all books, papers, manuals, maps, photographs, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by the Section under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business or in carrying out its treaty responsibilities and obligations, and preserved or appropriate for preservation by the Section as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the information value of the data in them, but does not include books, magazines or other material acquired solely for library purposes and through other sources, and does not include analyses, computations, or compilations of information not extant at the time of the request. The term “records” does not include objects or articles such as structures, furniture, paintings, sculptures, three-dimensional models, vehicles, and equipment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. In the case of “freelance” journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization even though not actually employed by it.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Request</E> means a letter or other written communication seeking records or information under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for commercial use to determine if any portion of that document is permitted to be withheld, and processing any document for disclosure (i.e., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release). It does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.<PRTPAGE P="474"/>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searches should be performed in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both the Section and the requester; for example, line-by-line searches should not be undertaken when it would be more efficient to duplicate the entire document. Note that such activity should be distinguished from “review” of material in determining whether the material is exempt from disclosure. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.</P>
        <P>The <E T="03">Section</E> means United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico.</P>
        <FP>All terms used in this part which are defined in 5 U.S.C. 552 shall have the same meaning herein.</FP>

      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 1102.3</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Procedures for requesting access to records or information.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) A request for any information or records shall be addressed to the FOIA Officer, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission,  4171  North  Mesa,  suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. The envelope and the letter shall be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Request” or “Request for Records,” or the equivalent, to distinguish it from other mail to the Section. If the request is not so marked and addressed, the 10-day time limit described in the Act will not begin to run until the request has been received by the FOIA Officer in the normal course of business. In each instance where a request is received in the normal course of business, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester that its request was improperly addressed and the date the request was received.</P>
        <P>(b) In order for the Section to locate records or information and make them available, it is necessary that it be able to identify the specific record or information sought. Persons wishing to inspect or obtain copies of records or information should, therefore, seek to identify them as fully and accurately as possible. In cases where requests are submitted which are not sufficient to permit identification, the FOIA Officer will endeavor to assist the persons seeking the records or information in filling in necessary details. In most cases, however, persons seeking records or information will find that time taken in trying to identify materials in the beginning is well worth their while in enabling the Section to respond promptly to their request.</P>
        <P>(c) A person submitting a request should—</P>
        <P>(1) Indicate the specific event or action, if any or if known, to which the request has reference.</P>
        <P>(2) Designate the Division, Branch, or Project Office of the Section which may be responsible for or may have produced the record or information requested.</P>
        <P>(3) Furnish the date of the record or information or the date or period to which it refers or relates, if known.</P>
        <P>(4) Name the character of record or information, such as a contract, an application, or a report.</P>
        <P>(5) List the Section's personnel who may have prepared or have knowledge of the record or information.</P>
        <P>(6) Furnish the reference material such as newspapers or publications which are known to have made a reference to the record or information desired.</P>
        <P>(7) If the request relates to a matter in pending litigation or one which has been litigated, supply the Court location and case style and number.</P>
        <P>(8) Describe, when the request includes more than one record or source of information, specifically each record or information so that availability may be separately determined.</P>
        <P>(9) Clearly indicate whether the request is an initial request or an appeal from a denial of a record or information previously requested.</P>
        <P>(10) Identify, when the request concerns a matter about the Section's personnel, the person as follows: First name, middle name or initial, and surname; date and place of birth; and social security account number, if known.</P>
        <P>(d) No particular format is needed for the request, except that it:</P>
        <P>(1) Must be in writing;<PRTPAGE P="475"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2) Must describe the records or information sought with sufficient detail to permit identification;</P>
        <P>(3) Should state a limitation of the fees the requester is willing to pay, if any; and</P>
        <P>(4) Must include the name, address, and telephone number (optional) of the person submitting the request.</P>

          </LDRWK>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>(ix) <E T="03">Postage and handling.</E> It will be up to the person requesting the records or information to designate how the material will be mailed or shipped. In the absence of such instructions no records or information will be sent to a foreign address, and records and information will be sent to domestic addresses utilizing first class certified mail, return receipt requested and will be billed at direct cost to the Section.</P>
        <P>(2) Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use will be charged for time spent reviewing records to determine whether thay are exempt from mandatory disclosure. The cost for review will be calculated based on the salary of the category of the employee who actually performed the review plus 16% of the rate to cover benefits. Charges will be assessed only for the initial review (i.e., review undertaken the first time in order to analyze the applicability of specific exemption(s) to a particular record or portion of record) and not review at the administrative appeal level of the exemption(s) already applied.</P>
        <P>(3) If records requested under this part are stored elsewhere than the headquarters of the U.S. Section, IBWC, 4171 North Mesa, EL Paso, TX, the special cost of returning such records to the headquarters shall be include in the search costs. These costs will be computed at the actual costs of transportation of either a person or the requested record between the place where the record is stored and the Section headquarters when, for time or other reasons, it is not feasible to rely on Government mail service.</P>
        <P>(4) When no specific fee has been established for a service, or the request for a service does not fall under one of the above categories due to the amount or size or type thereof, the FOIA Officer is authorized to establish an appropriate fee, pursuant to the criteria established in Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-25, entitled “User Charges.”</P>

        <P>(b) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this part will amount to more than $25 and the requester has not indicated in advance her/his willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated, the requester shall be <PRTPAGE P="476"/>promptly notified of the amount of the anticipated fees or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. The notice or request for an advance deposit shall extend an offer to the requester to confer with knowledgeable Section personnel in an attempt to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the fees and meet the needs of the requester. Dispatch of such notice or request shall suspend the running of the period for response by the Section until a reply is received from the requester.</P>
        <P>(c) Search costs are due and payable even if the record which was requested cannot be located after all reasonable efforts have been made, or if the Section determines that a record which has been requested, but which is exempt from disclosure under this part, is to be withheld.</P>
        <P>(d) The Section will begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The accrual of interest will be stayed upon receipt of the fee, rather than upon its processing by the Section. Interest will at the rate precribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C.</P>
        <P>(e) A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Section reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Section will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</P>
        <P>(f) The Section will not require a requester to make an advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, unless:</P>
        <P>(1) The Section estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then the Section will notify the requester of the likely costs and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or</P>
        <P>(2) Requesters who have previously failed to pay fees charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), the Section will require such requesters to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above or demonstrate that they have, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process new requests or pending requests from such requesters.</P>
        <FP>When the Section acts under paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section, the administrative time limit prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests plus permissible extensions of that time limit) will begin only after the Section has received payments described above.</FP>
        <P>(g) In accordance with the provisions and authorities of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), the Section reserves the right to disclose information to consumer reporting agencies and to use collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.</P>
        <P>(h) No fees under $10 will be billed by the Section because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee.</P>
        <P>(i) Requester should pay fees by check or money order made out to the U.S. Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, and mailed to the Finance and Accounting Office, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422.</P>

        <P>There are four categories of requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these categories. The Section will take into account information provided by requesters in determining their eligibility for inclusion in one of these categories is as defined in § 1102.2. It is in the requester's best interest to provide as much information as possible to demonstrate inclusion <PRTPAGE P="477"/>within a non-commercial category of fee treatment.</P>
        <P>(a) The Section will assess charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought for commercial use. Commercial use requesters are entitled to neither two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents.</P>
        <P>(b) The Section will provide documents to educational and non-commercial scientific institutions for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request being made is authorized by, and under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
        <P>(c) The Section will provide documents to representatives of the news media for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category; a requester must meet the criteria in § 1102.2(m), and the request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requesters, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.</P>
        <P>(d) The Section will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees which recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Moreover, requests from record subjects for records about themselves will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction.</P>
        <P>(e) In making determinations under this section, the Section may take into account whether requesters who previously were granted (b), (c), or (d) status under the Act did in fact use the requested records for purposes compatible with the status accorded them.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 1102.6</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Fee waivers and appeals.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Waiver or reduction of any fee provided for in § 1102.4 may be made upon a determination by the FOIA Officer, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. The Section shall furnish documents without charge or at a reduced charge provided that: Disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P>(1) In order to determine whether disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, the Section will consider the following four factors:</P>
        <P>(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Government;</P>
        <P>(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of Government operations or activities;</P>
        <P>(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding; and</P>
        <P>(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of Government operations or activities.</P>
        <P>(2) In order to determine whether disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Section will consider the following two factors:</P>

        <P>(i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so<PRTPAGE P="478"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
        <P>(b) The Section will not consider waiver or reduction of fees for requesters (persons or organizations) from whom unpaid fees remain due to the Section for another information access request.</P>
        <P>(c)(1) The Section's decision to refuse to waive or reduce fees as requested under paragraph (a) of this section may be appealed to the Commissioner, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, Suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. Appeals should contain as much information and documentation as possible to support the request for a waiver or reduction of fees.</P>
        <P>(2) Appeals will be reviewed by the Commissioner, who may consult with other officials of the Section as appropriate. The requester will be notified within thirty working days from the date on which the Section received the appeal.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 1102.7</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>The Section's determination and appeal procedures.</SUBJECT>
        <P>Upon receipt of any request for records of information under the Act the following guidelines shall be followed:</P>
        <P>(a) The FOIA Officer will determine within 10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request and will immediately notify the person making such request of such determination, the reasons therefore, and of the right to such person to appeal to the Commissioner any adverse determination.</P>
        <P>(b) All appeals should be addressed to the Commissioner, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, Suite, C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422, and should be clearly identified as such on the envelope and in the letter of appeal by using the marking “Freedom of Information Appeal” or “Appeal for Records” or the equivalent. Failure to properly address an appeal may defer the date of receipt by the Section to take into account the time reasonably required to forward the appeal to the Commissioner. In each instance when an appeal is incorrectly addressed to the Commissioner, he shall notify the person making the appeal that his appeal was improperly addressed and of the date the appeal was received by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will make a determination with respect to any appeal within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the receipt of an appeal. If on appeal the denial or the request is in whole or in part upheld, the Commissioner will notify the person making such request of the provisions for judicial review under the Act. An appeal must be in writing and filed within 30 days from receipt of the initial determination (in cases of denials of an entire request), or from receipt of any records being made available pursuant to the initial determination (in case of partial denials). In those cases where a request or appeal is not addressed to the proper official, the time limitations stated above will be computed from the receipt of the request or appeal by the proper official.</P>
        <P>(c) In unusual circumstances, as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, the time limits for responding to the original request or the appeal may be extended by not more than an additional 10 working days by written notice to the person making a request. This notice must be sent within either 10- or 20-day time limit and will specify the reason for the extension and the date on which determination is expected to be dispatched. The extension may be invoked only once during the consideration of a request either during the initial consideration period or during the consideration of an appeal, but not both.</P>
        <P>(d) The unusual circumstances are:</P>
        <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request.</P>

        <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct <PRTPAGE P="479"/>records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
        <P>(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the requestor among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</P>
        <P>(e) If the FOIA Officer receives a request which is of proper concern to an agency or entity outside the Section, it will be returned to the person making the request, advising the requester to refer it to the appropriate agency or entity if requester desires, and providing the requester with the name or title, address and other appropriate information. An information copy of the request and the letter of referral will be forwarded promptly to the agency or entity outside the Section that may expect the request. In the event the FOIA Officer receives a request to make available a record or provide information which is of interest to more than one agency (Federal, State, municipal, or legal entity created thereby), the FOIA Officer will retain and act upon the request if the Section is one of the interest agencies and if its interest in the record is paramount.</P>
        <P>(f) The Commissioner's determination on an appeal shall be in writing and when it denies records in whole or in part, the letter to the person making a request shall include:</P>
        <P>(1) Notation of the specific exemption or exemptions of the Act authorizing the withholding.</P>
        <P>(2) A statement that the decision is final for the Section.</P>
        <P>(3) Advice that judicial review of the denial is available in the district in which the person making the request resides or has his principal place of business, the district in which the Section's records are situated, or the District of Columbia.</P>
        <P>(4) The names and titles or positions of each official responsible for the denial of a request.</P>
        <FP>When appropriate, the written determination may also state how an exemption applied in that particular case, and, when relevant, why a discretionary rebase is not appropriate.</FP>
        <P>(g) In those cases where it is necessary to find and examine records before the legality or appropriateness of their disclosure can be determined, and where after diligent effort this has not been achieved within the required period, the FOIA Officer may advise the person making the request that a determination to presently deny the request has been made because the records or information have not been found or examined, that the determination will be considered when the search or examination is completed and the time within which completion is expected, but that the person making the request may immediately file an administrative appeal to the Commissioner.</P>

        <P>(d) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and</P>
        <P>(1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law, and</P>
        <P>(2) There is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this section.</P>

        <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1103.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
        <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>
        <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1103.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be <PRTPAGE P="485"/>undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
        <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
        <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
        <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
        <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

        <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
        <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
        <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
        <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
        <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
        <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>

        <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1103.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action <PRTPAGE P="486"/>that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

        <P>(a) Any person proposing to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands, and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal, shall apply to the Commissioner for a permit for the proposed work, and shall not begin the proposed work until a permit has been issued. The Commissioner may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for a permit meets conditions in § 1104.7(a) of this part.</P>
        <P>(b) Exceptions:<PRTPAGE P="489"/>
        </P>
        <P>(1) No permit shall be required under this part for any person conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the Commissioner's responsibility to comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources required for compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit requirements of this part.</P>
        <P>(2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaeological resource.</P>

        <P>(c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Commissioner's direction, associated with the management of archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application procedures of § 1104.5. However, the Commissioner shall insure that provisions of §§ 1104.7 and 1104.8 have been met by other documented means, and that any official duties which might result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural site, as determined by the Commissioner, have been the subject of consideration under § 1104.6.</P>
        <P>(d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf of the State or its educational institutions, the Commissioner shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of §§ 1104.4(b)(5), 1104.6, 1104.7(a) (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), 1104.8, 1104.9, 1104.11, and 1104.12(a) to such Governor or to such designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution approved by the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>(e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities governing the use of public lands, authorizations may be required for activities which do not require a permit under this part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands any activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this part should consult with the Commissioner, for the purpose of determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning such activities.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The maintenance of the highest standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality, and conduct by Government employees and special Government employees is essential to assure the proper performance of the Government business and the maintenance of confidence by citizens in their Government. The avoidance of misconduct and conflicts of interest on the part of Government employees and special Government employees through informed judgment is indispensable to the maintenance of these standards. To accord with these concepts the regulations in this part prescribe standards of conduct and responsibilities for employees and special Government employees and require statements reporting employment and financial interests.</P>

          <P>(a) Counseling services on employee responsibilities and conduct are available in each agency. These services are to be coordinated by a Counselor appointed by the agency head. The Counselor for IDCA is the General Counsel. The Counselor serves as the agency's designee to the Civil Service Commission on matters covered by the regulations in this part and is responsible for coordination of the agency's counseling services under paragraph (b) of this section and for assuring that counseling and interpretations on questions of conflicts of interest and other matters covered by these sections are available to deputy counselors designated under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

          <P>(b) Each agency head may designate deputy counselors for the agency's employees and special Government employees. Deputy Counselors designated under this section must be qualified and in a position to give authoritative advice and guidance to each employee and special Government employee who seeks advice and guidance on questions of conflicts of interest and on other matters covered by the regulations in this part. A Washington employee or special Government employee should address any inquiries concerning the regulations in this part to the Counselor. At missions abroad the chief of each agency's establishment designates an officer, preferably the legal officer where one is available, to provide counseling services under the guidance of the Counselor; a single officer may <PRTPAGE P="500"/>serve all agencies. An employee or special Government employee serving abroad should submit inquiries to the officer designated.</P>
          <P>(c) Each agency shall periodically notify its employees and special Government employees of the availability of counseling services and how and when these services are available. A new employee or special Government employee shall be notified at the time of entrance on duty.</P>

          <P>(1) Acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment of nominal value on infrequent occasions offered in the ordinary course of luncheons, dinners, or other meetings and gatherings hosted by foreign governments or agencies and officials thereof, embassies, and international organizations, where the primary purpose of the function is representational or social, rather than the transaction of business. Where the primary purpose of the function is the transaction of business, acceptance is not permitted, except if there is justification and reporting in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) Participation in widely attended lunches, dinners, and similar gatherings sponsored by industrial, technical, and professional associations for the discussion of matters of mutual interest to Government and industry.</P>
          <P>(3) Acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment in the unusual situation where the employee, by virtue of the location of the person, firm, corporation, or other entity, or the regulations governing its dining facilities, finds it inconvenient or impracticable not to accept the offer. Each case of acceptance shall be reported in accordance with the requirement of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. In no other case shall employees accept food, refreshments, or entertainment from private corporations, entities, firms, or individual contractors at occasions which are other than widely attended functions whose purposes are unrelated to Agency business.</P>

          <P>(4) In exceptional circumstances where acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment is not authorized by paragraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, but where, in the judgment of the individual concerned, the Government's interest would be served by such acceptance directly or indirectly from any foreign government, agency, or official thereof or a private person, firm, corporation, or other entity which is engaged or is endeavoring to engage in business transactions of any sort with AID, an employee may accept the offer: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That a report of the circumstances, together with the employee's statement as to how the Government's interests were served, will be made within 48 hours to the employee's supervisor, or, if the employee is serving abroad, or on temporary duty abroad, to the Mission Director.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Gifts to superiors.</E> An employee shall for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than the employee (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, or retirement.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Neither this section nor § 1203.735-204</E> precludes an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this part for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on the employee's behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official business under agency orders when reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.<PRTPAGE P="502"/>

          <P>(c) Pursuant to the provision of 18 U.S.C. 208(b) the following described financial interests of an employee are hereby exempted from the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and 208(b)(1) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of an employee. The exemption applies to the financial interests held directly by an employee, by the employee's spouse or minor child whether individually or jointly with the employee, or by an employee and any partner or partners as joint assets of the partnership:</P>
          <P>(1) Investments in State and local government bonds; and stocks, bonds, or policies in a mutual fund, investment company, bank or insurance company, provided that in the case of a mutual fund, investment company, or bank, the fair value of such stock or bond holding does not exceed one percent of the value of the reported assets of the mutual fund, investment company, or bank. In the case of a mutual fund or investment company, this exemption applies only where the assets of the fund or company are diversified; it does not apply where the fund or company specializes in a particular industry or commodity.</P>

          <P>(2) Interest in an investment club or other group organized for the purpose of investing in equity or debt securities: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the fair value of the interest involved does not exceed $10,000 and that the interest does not exceed one-fourth of the total assets of the investment club or group. Where an employee covered by this exemption is a member of a group organized for the purpose of investing in equity or debt securities, the interest of the employee in any enterprise in which the group holds securities shall be based upon the employee's equity share of the holdings of the group in that enterprise.</P>
          <P>(3) If an employee, or the employee's spouse or minor child has a present beneficial interest or a vested remainder interest under a trust, the ownership of stocks, bonds, or other corporate securities under the trust will be exempt to the same extent as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section for the direct ownership of such securities. The ownership of bonds other than corporate bonds, or of shares in a mutual fund or regulated investment company, under the trust will be equally exempt and to the same extent as under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.</P>

          <P>(4) If an employee is an officer, director, trustee, or employee of an educational institution, or if the employee is negotiating for, or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment with such an institution, a direct financial interest which the institution has in any matter will not itself be exempt, but any financial interest that the institution may have in the matter through its holdings of securities issued by business entities will be exempt: <E T="03">Provided,</E> The employee is not serving as a member of the investment committee of the institution or is not otherwise advising it on its investment portfolio.</P>
          <P>(5) An employee may continue to participate in a bona fide pension, retirement, group life, health or accident insurance plan, or other employee welfare or benefit plan that is maintained by a business or nonprofit organization by which the employee was formerly employed. Such financial interest in that organization will be exempt, except to the extent that the welfare or benefit plan is a profit-sharing or stock-bonus plan and the employee's financial interest thereunder exceeds $10,000. This exemption extends also to any financial interests that the organization may have in other business activities.</P>

          <P>(d) Nothing in this part shall be deemed to prohibit an employee from acting, with or without compensation, as agent or attorney for the employee's parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or for any estate for which, the employee is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary, except in <PRTPAGE P="504"/>those matters in which the employee has participated personally and substantially as a Government employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which are the subject of the employee's official responsibility, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(b): <E T="03">Provided,</E> The head of the employee's division approves in writing.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> For the purpose of this section, the term <E T="03">private organization</E> denotes any group of persons or associations organized for any purpose whatever, except an organization established by the Government of the United States, or officially participated in by IDCA.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Participation in activities of employee organizations.</E> An employee may join or refrain from joining employee organizations or associations without interference, coercion, restraint, or fear of discrimination or reprisal.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Participation in activities of private organizations.</E> In participating in the program and activities of any private organization, an employee shall make clear that the employee's agency has no official connection with such organization and does not necessarily sponsor or sanction the viewpoints which it may express.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Legal restrictions on membership in certain organizations.</E> An employee shall not have membership in any organization that advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of Government in the United States, knowing that such organization so advocates (5 U.S.C. 7311, 18 U.S.C. 1918).</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Private organizations concerned with foreign policy or other matters of concern to agencies.</E> (1) Limitation on participation. When a private organization is concerned primarily with foreign policy or international relations or other matters of concern to an employee's agency, an employee shall limit connection therewith as follows: Unless specifically permitted to do so, the employee may not serve as advisor, officer, director, teacher, sponsor, committee chairman, or in any other official capacity or permit the employee's name to be used on a letterhead, in a publication, in an announcement or news story, or at a public meeting, regardless of whether the employee's official title or connection is mentioned. The provisions of this section are not intented to prohibit the normal and active participation of an employee in professional organizations such as the American Political Science Association, the American Economic Association, the American Foreign Service Association, and similar organizations, since such participation is in the interest of both the employee and the Government. Employees are expected, however, to exercise discretion in such activities and are held personally accountable for any improper use of their relationship with IDCA.</P>
          <P>(2) Request for special permission. Special permission to assume or continue a connection prohibited by paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be granted in cases where the public interest will not be adversely affected. To request such permission, or to determine whether the provisions are applicable to a particular case, the employee shall address a memorandum setting forth all of the circumstances to the appropriate officer. The appropriate officer for IDCA is the Assistant Director for Administration.</P>
          <P>(3) Application to senior officers. Because of the prominence resulting from their official positions, chiefs of mission and other senior officers should recognize the particular bearing of the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon their activities. They should restrict association with any organizations involving foreign nations and the United States to simple membership and should not accept even honorary office in such organizations except with the specific prior approval as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Private organizations not concerned with foreign policy.</E> When the purpose and program of the organization do not fall primarily within the field of foreign policy or international relations, the employee's activity is limited only to the following extent:</P>
          <P>(1) The employee's official title or connection may be used to identify the employee, as in a civic association election, but may not be used on a letterhead, in a publication, or otherwise so as to employ the prestige of the U.S. Government to enhance that of the organization or to imply official sponsorship.</P>

          <P>(2) When the employee is a representative of an association consisting of <PRTPAGE P="506"/>IDCA employees, or of a group of such employees, the employee's connection with the agency may be freely used so long as there is no implication of official sponsorship beyond that which may have been officially approved.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Political activities abroad.</E> A U.S. citizen employee shall not engage in any form of political activity in any foreign country.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Activities relating to U.S. politics.</E> The law (5 U.S.C. 7324, formerly the Hatch Act) provides in summary that it is unlawful for any Federal employee of the executive branch to use the employee's official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the result thereof, or to take any active part in political management or in political campaigns. These restrictions do not in any way affect the right of a Federal employee (1) to vote as the employee chooses; (2) to express personal political opinions, except as part of a campaign; (3) to make or refrain from making contributions to political organizations, provided contributions are not made in a Federal building or to another Federal officer or employee (see 18 U.S.C. 602, 603, 607, and 608); (4) to participate in local, nonpartisan activities.</P>

A principal officer in answer to a letter of inquiry from outside the U.S. Government concerning a former employee assigned to the post, may state the length of time the person was employed at the post and the fact that the former employee performed duties in a satisfactory manner, if such is the case. Also, an AID Mission Director may provide names of persons or firms from which a cooperating government may select an employee or firm to be used in some phase of the AID program.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Making personal recommendations.</E> An employee may make a personal recommendation in connection with the employment of any person, including present or former employees, their spouses and/or members of their families, except for employment in a position of trust or profit under the government of the country to which the employee is accredited or assigned (22 U.S.C. 806(b)): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the employee does not divulge any information concerning the person derived from official sources. When a letter of introduction or recommendation is written by an employee, precautionary measures should be taken to prevent its being construed as official correspondence and used by an unscrupulous individual to impress American or foreign officials. Accordingly, official stationery should not be used for this purpose. The letter may, however, show the recommending employee's status as an employee of the U. S. Government. Every personal letter of recommendation shall contain a statement clearly indicating that the letter constitutes a personal recommendation and is not to be construed as an official <PRTPAGE P="507"/>recommendation by the Government of the United States.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Communications.</E> An employee shall not act as an agent for the transmission of communications from private persons or organizations in foreign countries to the President or to Federal, State, or municipal officials in the United States. A chief of mission may, however, accept communications of this nature and forward them to the Department of State for such further action as may be appropriate, whenever the chief of mission determines it to be clearly in the public interest to do so.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Gifts.</E> An employee shall not act as an agent for the transmission of gifts from persons or organizations in foreign countries to the President or to Federal, State, or municipal officials of the United States. However, principal officers may, according to regulations prescribed by the President, accept, and forward to the Office of Protocol of the Department of State, gifts made to the United States or to any political subdivision thereof by the Government to which they are accredited or from which they hold exequaturs.

          <P>(a) Where an employee is prohibited from participating in a matter because of a conflicting financial interest that is not exempt under § 1203.735-205(c) or has not been specifically excepted by the appropriate agency official pursuant to § 1203.735-217 in advance of the employee's participation in the particular matter, the employee shall conduct himself or herself in accordance with the following provisions:</P>
          <P>(1) The employee shall promptly disclose the financial interest in such matter to the employee's immediate superior. The superior will thereupon relieve the employee of duty and responsibility in the matter.</P>
          <P>(2) In foreign posts, it may be impossible or highly impracticable for an employee, who has a disqualifying financial interest, to assign the matter for official action to anyone other than a subordinate. In this event, the employee must instruct the subordinate to report fully and directly to the immediate superior to whom the employee himself or herself would normally report. The employee must concurrently direct such subordinate to take such action as may be appropriate in the matter, and without thereafter revealing to the disqualified employee in any way any aspect of the particular matter.</P>
          <P>(b) Nothing herein precludes the employee from disposing of such disqualifying financial interest, thereby wholly eliminating the conflict of interest. In some circumstances, where the employee may not obtain an exception under § 1203.735-217, or may not disqualify himself or herself and refer or assign the matter to another employee, the performance of duty may even require divestiture.</P>
          <P>(c) Where a supervisor has reason to believe that a subordinate employee may have a conflicting financial interest, the supervisor should discuss the matter with the employee. If the supervisor finds that a conflict of interest does exist, the supervisor must relieve the subordinate employee of duty and responsibility in the particular matter.</P>
          <P>(d) The obligation to avoid conflicts of interest is upon each employee. It is a continuing obligation calling for alert vigilance.</P>
          <P>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, if a employee's holdings rise in value above the amount exempted by § 1203.735-205(c), then the statutory and regulation prohibitions apply in a conflict of interest situation.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Organization of the Board for International Broadcasting.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Board for International Broadcasting is composed of ten members, one of whom—the President and Chief Operating Executive of RFE/RL, Inc.—is an ex officio member.

          <P>(b) The President of the United States appoints, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, nine voting members, one of whom he designates as Chairman. By law, the Board's membership must be bipartisan, with no more than five seats reserved for any one political party. The voting members are appointed for a term of three years. A member whose term has expired may continue to serve until his or her successor has been appointed and confirmed.</P>

          <P>(c) The nine voting members and the ex officio member of the BIB serve concurrently as the Board of Directors of RFE/RL, Inc. Unless specifically noted otherwise, all meetings of the Board are considered joint meetings of the Board for International Broadcasting and of the Board of Directors of RFE/RL, Inc. The Board of Directors make all major policy determinations governing the operation of RFE/RL, Inc., and appoints and fixes the compensation of managerial officers and employees of RFE/RL, Inc.<PRTPAGE P="517"/>

          <P>(e)(1) The Board, unless it votes otherwise, shall hold formal meetings no fewer than three times in a calendar year. Two of these meetings normally will be held in the United States; and one in Europe in connection with the annual meeting of the Corporation.</P>
          <P>(2) Five voting members constitute a quorum for the conduct of business. Actions of the Board shall be taken by a vote of at least five of the voting members. Members absent from a meeting may register their agreement or disagreement with the Board decisions in writing or by telephone to be included in the minutes of the meeting. The Chairman may, from time to time as events may require, solicit Board approval of decisions by telephone in the absence of a regularly scheduled meeting.</P>
          <P>(3) The BIB staff, under the direction of the Executive Director, shall be responsible for preparing for the Board meetings in the United States, including notification of members, physical arrangements, preparation of briefing books and a written agenda. The President of RFE/RL, Inc., coordinates the preparation of the European meeting of the Board, which normally is held at RFE/RL's Munich headquarters.</P>
          <P>(4) While attending meetings of the Board or engaged in activities directly related to the BIB or RFE/RL, Inc., the voting members of the Board are entitled to receive compensation equal to the daily equivalent of that prescribed for level V of the Executive Schedule under section 5316 of title 5, United States Code. While away from home on BIB business, members are entitled to travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law (5 U.S.C. 5703) for persons in the Government service who are employed intermittently.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The Executive Director is designated as the BIB's official responsible for implementation and oversight of information security programs and procedures. He acts as the recipient of questions, suggestions and complaints regarding all elements of this program, and is solely responsible for changes to it and for ensuring that it is at all times consistent with Executive Order 12356. The Executive Director also serves as the BIB's official contact for requests for declassification of materials submitted under the provisions of Executive Order 12356, regardless of the point or origin of such requests. He is responsible for ensuring that requests submitted under the Freedom of Information Act are handled in accordance with that Act and that declassification requests submitted under the provisions of Executive Order 12356 are acted upon within 60 days of receipt.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Mandatory declassification review.</E> Requests for mandatory review of national security information shall be in writing and addressed to the Executive Director, Board for International Broadcasting, Suite 1100, 1201 Connecticut Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20036. The request should describe the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable the Board's personnel to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. In light of the fact that the BIB does not have original classification authority and national security information in its custody has been classified by another Federal agency, the Executive Director shall refer all requests for national security information in its custody to the Federal agency that classified it for review and disposition in accordance with Executive Order 12356 and that agency's regulations and guidelines.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Handling.</E> All classified documents shall be delivered to the Executive Director or his designee immediately upon receipt. All potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the names of such designees and updated information as necessary. In the <PRTPAGE P="527"/>event that the Executive Director or his designee is not available to receive such documents, they shall be turned over to the Budget and Administrative Officer and secured, unopened, in the combination safes located in the file room of the BIB offices until the Executive Director or his designee is available. Under no circumstances shall classified materials that cannot be delivered to the Executive Director or his designee be stored other than in the designated safes.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Reproduction.</E> Reproduction of classified material shall take place only in accordance with Executive Order 12065, section 4-4, and any limitations imposed by the originator. Should copies be made, they are subject to the same controls as the original document. Records showing the number and distribution of copies shall be maintained, where required by the executive order, by the Budget and Administrative Officer, and the log shall be stored with the original documents. These measures shall not restrict reproduction for the purposes of mandatory review.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Storage.</E> All classified documents shall be stored in the combination safes located in the file room of the BIB offices. The combination shall be changed as required by Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) Directive No. 1, section IV-F-5-a. The combination shall be known only to the Executive Director and his designees each of whom must have the appropriate security clearance.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Employee education.</E> All employees who have been granted a security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials shall be advised of handling, reproduction and storage procedures and shall be required to review Executive Order 12065 and appropriate ISOO directives. This shall be accomplished by a memorandum to all affected employees at the time these procedures are implemented. New employees will be instructed in procedures as they enter employment with the BIB.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Agency terminology.</E> The use of the terms “Top Secret”, “Secret” and “Confidential” shall be limited to materials classified for national security purposes.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1304.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>

          <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1304.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens <PRTPAGE P="531"/>but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>

          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices <PRTPAGE P="532"/>for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>

          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1304.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>(a) Except where the Board determines that the public interest requires otherwise, meetings, or portions thereof, shall not be open to public observation where the deliberations concern the issuance of a subpoena, the Board participation in a civil action or proceeding or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct or disposition by the Board of particular cases of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing, or any court proceedings collateral or ancillary thereto.</P>

            <P>A meeting shall be closed to public observation under § 1413.4, only when a majority of the members of the Board who will participate in the meeting vote to take such action.</P>
            <P>(a) When the meeting deliberations concern matters specified in § 1413.4(a), the Board members shall vote at the beginning of the meeting, or portion thereof, on whether to close such meeting, or portion thereof, to public observation and on whether the public interest requires that a meeting which may properly be closed should nevertheless be open to public observation. A record of such vote, reflecting the vote of each member of the Board, shall be kept and made available to the public at the earliest practicable time.</P>
            <P>(b) When the meeting deliberations concern matters specified in § 1413.4(b), the Board shall vote on whether to close such meeting, or portion thereof, to public observation, and on whether there is a public interest which requires that a meeting which may properly be closed should nevertheless be open to public observation.

The change made and the vote of each member on the change shall be announced publicly at the earliest practicable time.</P>
            <P>(e) Before a meeting may be closed pursuant to § 1413.4, the Solicitor of the Authority shall certify that in the Solicitor's opinion the meeting may properly be closed to public observation.

            <P>(c) Within one (1) day after a vote to close a meeting, or any portion thereof, pursuant to the provisions of § 1413.4(b), the agency shall make publicly available a full written explanation of its action closing the meeting, or portion thereof, together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</P>
            <P>(d) If after public announcement required by paragraph (b) of this section has been made, the time and place of the meeting are changed, a public announcement shall be made at the earliest practicable time.

            <P>(a) When there is no certified exclusive representative of the employees, a petition will be considered timely filed provided a valid election has not been held within the preceding twelve (12) month period in the unit described in 22 U.S.C. 4112.</P>

            <P>(b) When there is a certified exclusive representative of the employees, a petition will not be considered timely if filed within twenty-four (24) months after the certification as the exclusive representative of employees in unit described in 22 U.S.C. 4112, unless a signed and dated collective bargaining agreement covering the unit has been entered into in which case paragraphs <PRTPAGE P="554"/>(c) and (d) of this section shall be applicable.</P>
            <P>(c) When a collective bargaining agreement covering the unit described in 22 U.S.C. 4112 has been signed and dated by the Department and the incumbent exclusive representative, a petition for exclusive recognition or other election petition will not be considered timely if filed during the period of review by the Secretary as set forth in 22 U.S.C. 4113(f), absent unusual circumstances.</P>
            <P>(d) A petition for exclusive recognition or other election petition will be considered timely when filed as follows:</P>

            <P>(3) Any time when unusual circumstances exist which substantially affect the unit or the majority representation.</P>

            <P>(e) When a collective bargaining agreement having a term of three (3) years or less is in effect between the Department and the incumbent exclusive representative, and a petition has been filed challenging the representation status of the incumbent exclusive representative and the petition is subsequently withdrawn or dismissed less than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date of that collective bargaining agreement, or any time thereafter, the Department and incumbent exclusive representative shall be afforded a ninety (90) day period from the date the withdrawal is approved or the petition is dismissed free from rival claim within which to consummate a collective bargaining agreement: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That the provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable when any other petition is pending which has been filed pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) When an extension of a collective bargaining agreement having a term of three (3) years or less has been signed more than sixty (60) days before its expiration date, such extension shall not serve as a basis for the denial of a petition submitted in accordance with the time limitations provided herein.</P>
            <P>(g) Collective bargaining agreements which go into effect automatically pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 4113(f) and which do not contain the date on which the agreement became effective shall not constitute a bar to an election petition.</P>
            <P>(h) A petitioner who withdraws a petition after the issuance of a notice of hearing or after the approval of an agreement for an election, shall be barred from filing another petition for the unit described in 22 U.S.C. 4112 for six (6) months, unless a withdrawal request has been received by the Regional Director not later than three (3) days before the date of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(i) The time limits set forth in this section shall not apply to a petition for clarification of unit or for amendment of recognition or certification, or to a petition for dues allotment.</P>

            <P>(f) The Regional Director shall make such investigation as the Regional Director deems necessary and thereafter shall take action which may consist of the following, as appropriate:</P>

A party may file with the Board a request for review of such action of the Regional Director in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1422.6(d). If no request for review is filed, or if one is filed and denied, the Regional Director shall take such action as may be appropriate, which may include issuing a clarification of unit or an amendment of recognition or certification, or determination of eligibility for dues allotment.</P>
            <P>(h) A determination by the Regional Director to issue a notice of hearing shall not be subject to review by the Board.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Intervention.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) No labor organization will be permitted to intervene in any proceeding involving a petition filed pursuant to § 1422.2 (a) or (b) unless it has submitted to the Regional Director a showing of interest of ten percent (10%) or more of the employees in the unit described in 22 U.S.C. 4112 together with an alphabetical list of names constituting such showing, or has submitted a current or recently expired agreement with the Department covering any of the employees involved, or has submitted evidence that it is currently recognized or certified exclusive representative of any of the employees involved: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That an incumbent exclusive representative shall be deemed to be an intervenor in the proceeding unless it serves on the Regional Director a written disclaimer of any representation interest for the employees involved: <E T="03">Provided, further,</E> That any such incumbent exclusive representative that declines to sign an agreement for consent election because of a disagreement on the matters contained in § 1422.7(c) as decided by the Regional Director, or fails to appear at a hearing held pursuant to § 1422.9, shall be denied its status as an intervenor.</P>

            <P>(b) No labor organization may participate to any extent in any representation proceeding unless it has notified the Regional Director in writing, accompanied by its showing of interest as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, of its desire to intervene within twenty (20) days after the initial date of posting of the notice of petition as provided in § 1422.4(a), unless good <PRTPAGE P="556"/>cause is shown for extending the period. A copy of the request for intervention filed with the Regional Director, excluding the showing of interest, shall be served on all known interested parties, and a written statement of such service should be filed with the Regional Director: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That an incumbent exclusive representative shall be deemed to be an intervenor in the proceeding in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) Any labor organization seeking to intervene in a proceeding involving a petition for determination of eligibility for dues allotment filed pursuant to § 1422.2(d) may intervene solely on the basis it claims to be the exclusive representative of some or all the employees specified in the petition and shall submit to the Regional Director a current or recently expired agreement with the Department covering any of the employees involved, or evidence that it is the currently recognized or certified exclusive representative of any of the employees involved.</P>
            <P>(d) Any labor organization seeking to intervene must submit to the Regional Director a statement that it has submitted to the Department and to the Assistant Secretary a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its constitution and bylaws, and a statement of its objectives.</P>
            <P>(e) The Regional Director may grant intervention to a labor organization in a proceeding involving a petition for clarification of unit or a petition for amendment of recognition or certification filed pursuant to § 1422.2(c), or a petition for determination of eligibility for dues allotment filed pursuant to § 1422.2(d), based on a showing that the proposed clarification, amendment or dues allotment affects that labor organizations's existing exclusively recognized unit(s) in that it would cover one or more employees who are included in such unit(s).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Withdrawal, dismissal or deferral of petitions; consolidation of cases; denial of intervention; review of action by Regional Director.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the Regional Director determines, after such investigation as the Regional Director deems necessary, that the petition has not been timely filed, the unit is not as described in 22 U.S.C. 4114, the petitioner has not made a sufficient showing of interest, the petition is not otherwise actionable, or an intervention is not appropriate, the Regional Director may request the petitioner or intervenor to withdraw the petition or the request for intervention. In the absence of such withdrawal within a reasonable period of time, the Regional Director may dismiss the petition or deny the request for intervention.</P>
            <P>(b) If the Regional Director determines, after investigation, that a valid issue has been raised by a challenge under § 1422.2 (f) or (g), the Regional Director may take action which may consist of the following, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) Request the petitioner or intervenor to withdraw the petition or the request for intervention;</P>
            <P>(2) Dismiss the petition and/or deny the request for intervention if a withdrawal request is not submitted within a reasonable period of time;</P>
            <P>(3) Defer action on the petition or request for intervention until such time as issues raised by the challenges have been resolved pursuant to this part; or</P>

            <P>This section governs all elections conducted under the supervision of the Regional Director pursuant to § 1422.7 or § 1422.16. The Regional Director may conduct elections in unusual circumstances in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in the notice of election.</P>
            <P>(a) Appropriate notices of election shall be posted by the Department. Such notices shall set forth the details and procedures for the election, the unit described in 22 U.S.C. 4112, the eligibility period, the date(s), hour(s) and place(s) of the election and shall contain a sample ballot.</P>

            <P>(b) The reproduction of any document purporting to be a copy of the official ballot, other than one completely unaltered in form and content and clearly marked “sample” on its face, <PRTPAGE P="560"/>which suggests either directly or indirectly to employees that the Board endorses a particular choice, may constitute grounds for setting aside an election upon objections properly filed.</P>
            <P>(c) All elections shall be by secret ballot. An exclusive representative shall be chosen by a majority of the valid ballots cast.</P>
            <P>(d) Whenever two or more labor organizations are included as choices in an election, any intervening labor organization may request the Regional Director to remove its name from the ballot. The request must be in writing and received not later than seven (7) days before the date of the election. Such request shall be subject to the approval of the Regional Director whose decision shall be final.</P>
            <P>(e) In a proceeding involving an election to determine if a labor organization should cease to be the exclusive representative filed by the Department or any employee or employees or an individual acting on behalf of any employee(s) under § 1422.2(b), an organization currently recognized or certified may not have its name removed from the ballot without having served the written request submitted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section on all parties. Such request shall contain an express disclaimer of any representation interest among the employees in the unit.</P>
            <P>(f) Any party may be represented at the polling place(s) by observers of its own selection, subject to such limitations as the Regional Director may prescribe.</P>
            <P>(g) A party's request to the Regional Director for named observers shall be in writing and filed with the Regional Director not less than fifteen (15) days prior to an election to be supervised or conducted pursuant to this part. The request shall name and identify the authorized representation election observers sought, and state the reasons therefor. Copies thereof shall be served on the other parties and a written statement of such service shall be filed with the Regional Director. Within five (5) days after service of a copy of the request, a party may file objections to the request with the Regional Director and state the reasons therefor. Copies thereof shall be served on the other parties and a written statement of such service shall be filed with the Regional Director. The Regional Director shall rule upon the request not later than five (5) days prior to the date of the election. However, for good cause shown by a party, or on the Regional Director's own motion, the Regional Director may vary the time limits prescribed in this paragraph.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Certification; objections to election; determination on objections and challenged ballots.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Regional Director shall issue to the parties a certification of results of the election or a certification of representative, where appropriate: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That no objections are filed within the time limit set forth below; the challenged ballots are insufficient in number to affect the results of the election; and no rerun election is to be held.</P>

            <P>(b) Within twenty (20) days after the tally of ballots has been furnished, a party may file objections to the procedural conduct of the election, or to conduct which may have improperly affected the results of the election, setting forth a clear and concise statement of the reasons therefor. The objecting party shall bear the burden of proof at all stages of the proceeding regarding all matters raised in its objections. An original and two (2) copies of the objections shall be filed with the Regional Director and copies shall be served on the parties. A statement of such service shall be filed with the Regional Director. Such filing must be timely whether or not the challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the election. Within <PRTPAGE P="561"/>ten (10) days after the filing of the objections, unless an extension of time has been granted by the Regional Director, the objecting party shall file with the Regional Director evidence, including signed statements, documents and other material supporting the objections.</P>
            <P>(c) If objections are filed or challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the election, the Regional Director shall investigate the objections or challenged ballots, or both.</P>
            <P>(d) When the Regional Director determines that no relevant question of fact exists, the Regional Director (1) shall find whether improper conduct occurred of such a nature as to warrant the setting aside of the election and, if so, indicate an intention to set aside the election, or (2) shall rule on determinative challenged ballots, if any, or both. The Regional Director shall issue a report and findings on objections and/or challenged ballots which shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding. Such report and findings shall state therein any additional pertinent matters such as an intent to rerun the election or count ballots at a specified date, time, and place, and if appropriate, that the Regional Director will cause to be issued a revised tally of ballots.</P>
            <P>(e) When the Regional Director determines that no relevant question of fact exists, but that a substantial question of interpretation or policy exists, the Regional Director shall notify the parties in the report and findings and transfer the case to the Board in accordance with of this subchapter.</P>

            <P>(f) Any party aggrieved by the findings of a Regional Director with respect to objections to an election or challenged ballots may obtain a review of such action by the Board by following the procedure set forth in § 1422.6(d) of this subchapter: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That a determination by the Regional Director to issue a notice of hearing shall not be subject to review by the Board.</P>
            <P>(g) Where it appears to the Regional Director that the objections or challenged ballots raise any relevant question of fact which may have affected the results of the election, the Regional Director shall cause to be issued a notice of hearing. Hearings shall be conducted and decisions issued by Administrative Law Judges and exceptions and related submissions filed with the Board in accordance with §§ 1423.14 through 1423.28 of this subchapter excluding § 1423.18 and § 1423.19(j), with the following exceptions:</P>
            <P>(1) The Administrative Law Judge may not recommend remedial action to be taken or notices to be posted, as provided under § 1423.26(a); and</P>
            <P>(2) Reference to “charge, complaint” in § 1423.26(b) shall be read as “report and findings of the Regional Director.”</P>
            <P>(h) At a hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section the party filing the objections shall have the burden of proving all matters alleged in its objections by a preponderance of the evidence. With respect to challenged ballots, no burden of proof is imposed on any party.</P>
            <P>(i) The Board shall take action which may consist of the following, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) Issue a decision adopting, modifying, or rejecting the Administrative Law Judge's decision;</P>
            <P>(2) Issue a decision in any case involving a substantial question of interpretation or policy transferred pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(3) Issue a ruling with respect to a request for review filed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section affirming or reversing, in whole or in part, the Regional Director's findings, or make such other disposition as may be appropriate.</P>

            <P>(a) The purposes and policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute can best be achieved by the cooperative efforts of all persons covered by the program. To this end, it shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to encourage all persons alleging unfair labor practices and persons against whom such allegations are made to meet and, in good faith, attempt to resolve such matters prior to the filing of unfair labor practice charges with the Board.</P>
            <P>(b) In furtherance of the policy referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, and noting the six (6) month period of limitation set forth in 22 U.S.C. 4116(d), it shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to encourage the informal resolution of unfair labor practice allegations subsequent to the filing of a charge and prior to the issuance of a complaint by the Regional Director.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and documents.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A charge alleging a violation of 22 U.S.C. 4115 shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the Board and shall contain the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The name, address and telephone number of the person(s) making the charge;</P>
            <P>(2) The name, address and telephone number of the Department or labor organization against whom the charge is made;</P>

            <P>(3) A clear and concise statement of the facts constituting the alleged unfair labor practice, a statement of the <PRTPAGE P="563"/>section(s) and subsection(s) of chapter 41 of title 22 of the United States Code alleged to have been violated, and the date and place of occurrence of the particular acts; and</P>
            <P>(4) A statement of any other procedure invoked involving the subject matter of the charge and the results, if any, including whether the subject matter raised in the charge (i) has been raised previously in a grievance procedure; (ii) has been referred to the Foreign Service Impasse Disputes Panel or the Foreign Service Grievance Board for consideration or action; or (iii) involves a negotiability issue raised by the charging party in a petition pending before the Board pursuant to part 1424 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(b) Such charge shall be in writing and signed and shall contain a declaration by the person signing the charge, under the penalties of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 1001), that its contents are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief.</P>
            <P>(c) When filing a charge, the charging party shall submit to the Regional Director any supporting evidence and documents.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or the negotiability procedure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to this part which involves a negotiability issue, and the labor organization also files pursuant to part 1424 of this subchapter a petition for review of the same negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge and the petition for review simultaneously.</P>
            <P>(b) Under such circumstances, the labor organization must select under which procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this selection must be made in writing at the time that both procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the Board, the appropriate Regional Director and all parties to both the unfair labor practice case and the negotiability case.</P>
            <P>(c) Cases which solely involve an agency's allegation that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be filed under part 1424 of this subchapter.</P>

            <P>(a) An original and four (4) copies of the charge together with one copy for each additional charged party named shall be filed with the Regional Director for the region in which the alleged unfair labor practice has occurred or is occurring. A charge alleging that an unfair labor practice has occurred or is occurring in two or more regions may be filed with the Regional Director for any such region.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon the filing of a charge, the charging party shall be responsible for the service of a copy of the charge (without the supporting evidence and documents) upon the person(s) against whom the charge is made, and for filing a written statement of such service with the Regional Director. The Regional Director will, as a matter of course, cause a copy of such charge to be served on the person(s) against whom the charge is made, but shall not be deemed to assume responsibility for such service.</P>

            <P>(b) During the course of the investigation all parties involved will have an opportunity to present their evidence and views to the Regional Director.</P>
            <P>(c) In connection with the investigation of charges, all persons are expected to cooperate fully with the Regional Director.</P>

            <P>(d) The purposes and policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute can best be achieved by the full cooperation of all parties involved and the voluntary submission of all potentially relevant information <PRTPAGE P="564"/>from all potential sources during the course of the investigation. To this end, it shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to protect the identity of individuals and the substance of the statements and information they submit or which is obtained during the investigation as a means of assuring the Board's and the General Counsel's continuing ability to obtain all relevant information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Action by the Regional Director.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Regional Director shall take action which may consist of the following, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) Approve a request to withdraw a charge;</P>
            <P>(2) Refuse to issue a complaint;</P>

            <P>(6) Withdraw a complaint.</P>
            <P>(b) Parties may request the General Counsel to seek appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) under 22 U.S.C. 4109(d). The General Counsel will initiate and prosecute injunctive proceedings under 22 U.S.C. 4109(d) only upon approval of the Board. A determination by the General Counsel not to seek approval of the Board for such temporary relief is final and may not be applied to the Board.</P>
            <P>(c) Upon a determination to issue a complaint, whenever it is deemed advisable by the Board to seek appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) under 22 U.S.C. 4109(d), the Regional Attorney or other designated agent of the Board to whom the matter has been referred will make application for appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Such temporary relief will not be sought unless the record establishes probable cause that an unfair labor practice is being committed, or if such temporary relief will interfere with the ability of the Department to carry out its essential functions.</P>
            <P>(d) Whenever temporary relief has been obtained pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 4109(d) and thereafter the Administrative Law Judge hearing the complaint, upon which the determination to seek such temporary relief was predicated, recommends dismissal of such complaint, in whole or in part, the Regional Attorney or other designated agent of the Board handling the case for the Board shall inform the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of the possible change in circumstances arising out of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination not to issue complaint; review of action by the Regional Director.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the Regional Director determines that the charge has not been timely filed, that the charge fails to state an unfair labor practice, or for other appropriate reasons, the Regional Director may request the charging party to withdraw the charge, and in the absence of such withdrawal within a reasonable time, decline to issue a complaint.</P>
            <P>(b) If the Regional Director determines not to issue a complaint on a charge which is not withdrawn, the Regional Director shall provide the parties with a written statement of the reasons for not issuing a complaint.</P>

            <P>(c) The charging party may obtain a review of the Regional Director's decision not to issue a complaint by filing an appeal with the General Counsel within twenty-five (25) days after service of the Regional Director's decision. The appeal shall contain a complete statement setting forth the facts and reasons upon which it is based. A copy of the appeal shall also be filed with the Regional Director. In addition, the charging party should notify all other parties of the fact that an appeal has been taken, but any failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the appeal.<PRTPAGE P="565"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) A request for extension of time to file an appeal shall be in writing and received by the General Counsel not later than five (5) days before the date the appeal is due. The charging party should notify the Regional Director and all other parties that it has requested an extension of time in which to file an appeal, but any failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of its request for an extension of time to file an appeal.</P>
            <P>(e) The General Counsel may sustain the Regional Director's refusal to issue or re-issue a complaint, stating the grounds of affirmance, or may direct the Regional Director to take further action. The General Counsel's decision shall be served on all the parties. The decision of the General Counsel shall be final.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="SHD1">General settlement policy</HD>
  <P>(a) At any stage of a proceeding prior to hearing, where time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest permit, all interested parties shall have the opportunity to submit to the Regional Director with whom the charge was filed, for consideration, all facts and arguments concerning offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment.</P>
  <HD SOURCE="SHD1">Precomplaint informal settlements</HD>
  <P>(b)(1) Prior to the issuance of any complaint or the taking of other formal action, the Regional Director will afford the charging party and the respondent a reasonable period of time in which to enter into an informal settlement agreement to be approved by the Regional Director. Upon approval by the Regional Director and compliance with the terms of the informal settlement agreement, no further action shall be taken in the case. If the respondent fails to perform its obligations under the informal settlement agreement, the Regional Director may determine to institute further proceedings.</P>
  <P>(2) In the event that the charging party fails or refuses to become a party to an informal settlement agreement offered by the respondent, if the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the respondent and the Regional Director and the latter shall decline to issue a complaint. The charging party may obtain a review of the Regional Director's action by filing an appeal with the General Counsel in accordance with § 1423.10(c). The General Counsel shall take action on such appeal as set forth in § 1423.10(e).</P>
  <HD SOURCE="SHD1">Post complaint settlement policy</HD>
  <P>(c) Consistent with the policy reflected in paragraph (a) of this section, even after the issuance of a complaint, the Board favors the settlement of issues. Such settlements may be either informal or formal. Informal settlement agreements shall be accomplished as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Formal settlement agreements are subject to the approval of the Board. In such formal settlement agreements, the parties shall agree to waive their right to a hearing and agree further that the Board may issue an order requiring the respondent to take action appropriate to the terms of the settlement. Ordinarily the formal settlement agreement also contains the respondent's consent to the Board application for the entry of a decree by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia enforcing the Board's order.</P>
  <HD SOURCE="SHD1">Post complaint—prehearing formal settlements</HD>
  <P>(d)(1) If, after issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, the charging party and the respondent enter into a formal settlement agreement, and such agreement is accepted by the Regional Director, the formal settlement agreement shall be submitted to the Board for approval.</P>

  <P>(2) If, after issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, the charging party fails or refuses to become a party to a formal settlement agreement offered by the respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between <PRTPAGE P="566"/>the respondent and the Regional Director. The charging party will be so informed and provided a brief written statement by the Regional Director of the reasons therefor. The formal settlement agreement together with the charging party's objections, if any, and the Regional Director's written statements, shall be submitted to the Board for approval. The Board may approve or disapprove any formal settlement agreement or return the case to the Regional Director for other appropriate action.</P>
  <HD SOURCE="SHD1">Post complaint—prehearing informal settlements</HD>
  <P>(3) After the issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, if the Regional Director concludes that it will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Regional Director may withdraw the complaint and approve an informal settlement agreement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
  <HD SOURCE="SHD1">Informal settlements after the opening of the hearing</HD>
  <P>(e)(1) After issuance of a complaint and after opening of the hearing, if the Regional Director concludes that it will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge for permission to withdraw the complaint and, having been granted such permission to withdraw the complaint, may approve an informal settlement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
  <HD SOURCE="SHD1">Formal settlements after the opening of the hearing</HD>
  <P>(2) If, after issuance of a complaint and after opening of the hearing, the parties enter into a formal settlement agreement, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge to approve such formal settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement to the Board for approval.</P>
  <P>(3) If the charging party fails or refuses to become a party to a formal settlement agreement offered by the respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the respondent and the Regional Director. After the charging party is given an opportunity to state on the record or in writing the reasons for opposing the formal settlement, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge to approve such formal settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement to the Board for approval. The Board may approve or disapprove any formal settlement agreement or return the case to the Administrative Law Judge for another appropriate action.</P>

Failure to file an answer or to plead specifically to or explain any allegation shall constitute an admission of such allegation and shall be so found by the Board, unless good cause to the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>(c) Upon the Regional Director's own motion or upon proper cause shown by any other party, the Regional Director issuing the complaint may by written order extend the time within which the answer shall be filed.</P>
    <P>(d) The answer may be amended by the respondent at any time prior to the hearing. During the hearing or subsequent thereto, the answer may be amended in any case where the complaint has been amended, within such period as may be fixed by the Administrative Law Judge or the Board.

      <SUBJECT>Conditions governing review.</SUBJECT>
      <P>Pursuant to the authority contained in 22 U.S.C. 4107 (a)(3) and (c)(1) the Board will consider a direct appeal concerning whether a matter proposed to be bargained is within the obligation to bargain under the Foreign Service Act of 1980 as follows: If the Department is involved in collective bargaining with an exclusive representative and alleges that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to any matter proposed to be bargained because, as proposed, the matter is inconsistent with applicable law, rule or regulation the exclusive representative may appeal the allegation to the Board when it disagrees with Department's allegation that the matter as proposed to be bargained is inconsistent with applicable law, rule or regulation.</P>

      <P>(a) The time limit for filing an appeal under this part is fifteen (15) days from the Department's allegation, which was requested in writing by the exclusive representative, is served on the exclusive representative. The Department shall make the allegation in writing and serve a copy on the exclusive representative: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That review of a negotiability issue may be requested by the exclusive representative under this part without a prior written allegation by the Department if a written allegation has not been served upon the exclusive representative within ten (10) days after the date of receipt by any Department bargaining representative at the negotiations of a written request for such allegation.</P>

      <P>(3) Notification by the petitioning labor organization whether the negotiability issue is also involved in an unfair labor parctice charge filed by such labor organization under part 1423 of this subchapter and pending before the General Counsel.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or the negotiability procedure.</SUBJECT>

      <P>Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 1423 of this subchapter which involves a negotiability issue, and the labor organization also files pursuant to this part a petition for review of the same negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such circumstances, the labor organization must select under which procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this selection must be made in writing at the time that both procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the Board, the appropriate Regional Director and all parties to <PRTPAGE P="573"/>both the unfair labor practice case and the negotiability case. Cases which solely involve the Department's allegation that the duty bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be filed under this part.</P>

      <P>(2) Setting forth in full its position on any matters relevant to the petition which it wishes the Board to consider in reaching its decision, including a full and detailed statement of its reasons supporting the allegation. The statement shall cite the section of any law, rule or regulation relied upon as a basis for the allegation.</P>

      <P>(b) If the Board finds that the duty to bargain extends to the matter proposed to be bargained, the decision of the Board shall include an order that the Department shall upon request (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties) bargain concerning such matter. If the Board finds that the duty to bargain does not extend to the matter proposed to be bargained, the Board shall so state and issue an order dismissing the petition for review of the negotiability issue. If the Board finds that the duty to bargain extends to the matter proposed to be bargained only at the election of the Department, the Board shall so state and issue an order dismissing the petition for review of the negotiability issue.</P>

      <P>(c) When an order is issued as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Department or exclusive representative shall report to the appropriate Regional Director within a specified <PRTPAGE P="574"/>period failure to comply with an order that the Department shall upon request (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties) bargain concerning the disputed matter. If the Board finds such a failure to comply with its order, the Board shall take whatever action it deems necessary, including enforcement under 22 U.S.C. 4109(b).</P>

        <P>(a) In any representation case under part 1422 of this subchapter in which the Regional Director determines, based upon a stipulation by the parties, that no material issue of fact exists, the Regional Director may transfer the case to the Board; and the Board may decide the case on the basis of the papers alone after having allowed twenty-five (25) days for the filing of briefs. In any unfair labor practice case under part 1423 of this subchapter in which, after the issuance of a complaint, the Regional Director determines, based upon a stipulation by the parties, that no material issue of fact exists, the Regional Director may upon agreement of all parties transfer the case to the Board; and the Board shall decide the case on the basis of the case papers alone after having allowed twenty-five (25) days for the filing of briefs. The Board may remand any such case to the Regional Director if it determines that a material question of fact does exist. Orders of transfer and remand shall be served on all parties.</P>
        <P>(b) In any case under parts 1422 and 1423 of this subchapter in which it appears to the Regional Director that the proceedings raise questions which should be decided by the Board, the Regional Director may, at any time, issue an order transferring the case to the Board for decision or other appropriate action.

        <SECTNO>§ 1429.7</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Subpoenas.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Any member of the Board, the General Counsel, any Administrative Law Judge appointed by the Board under 5 U.S.C. 3105, and any Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or other employee of the Board designated by the Board may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary or other evidence. However, no subpoena shall be issued under this section which requires the disclosure of intramanagement guidance, advice, counsel, or training within an agency or between an agency and the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
        <P>(b) Where the parties are in agreement that the appearance of witnesses or the production of documents is necessary, and such witnesses agree to appear, no such subpoena need be sought.</P>
        <P>(c) A request for a subpoena by any person, as defined in 22 U.S.C. 4102 shall be in writing and filed with the Regional Director, in proceedings arising under parts 1422 and 1423 of this subchapter, or filed with the Board, in proceedings arising under parts 1424 and 1425 of this subchapter, not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the opening of a hearing, or with the appropriate presiding official(s) during the hearing.</P>
        <P>(d) All requests shall name and identify the witnesses or documents sought, and state the reasons therefor. The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall grant the request upon the determination that the testimony or documents appear to be necessary to the matters under investigation and the request describes with sufficient particularity the documents sought. Service of an approved subpoena is the responsibility of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued. The subpoena shall show on its face the name and address of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued.</P>

        <P>(e) Any person served with a subpoena who does not intend to comply, shall, within five (5) days after the date of service of the subpoena upon such person, petition in writing to revoke the subpoena. A copy of any petition to revoke a subpoena shall be served on the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued. Such petition to revoke, if made prior to the hearing, and a written statement of service, shall be filed with the Regional Director, who may refer the petition to the Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, for ruling. A petition to revoke a subpoena filed during the hearing, and a written statement of <PRTPAGE P="578"/>service, shall be filed with the appropriate presiding official(s). The Regional Director, or the appropriate presiding official(s) will, as a matter of course, cause a copy of the petition to revoke to be served on the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, but shall not be deemed to assume responsibility for such service. The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall revoke the subpoena if the evidence the production of which is required does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings, or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence the production of which is required, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is invalid. The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall make a simple statement of procedural or other ground for the ruling on the petition to revoke. The petition to revoke, any answer thereto, and any ruling thereon shall not become part of the official record except upon the request of the party aggrieved by the ruling.</P>
        <P>(f) Upon the failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued, upon the request of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, the General Counsel shall, on behalf of such party, institute proceedings in the appropriate district court for the enforcement thereof, unless, in the judgment of the General Counsel, the enforcement of such subpoena would be inconsistent with law and the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The General Counsel shall not be deemed thereby to have assumed responsibility for the effective prosecution of the same before the court thereafter.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 1429.8</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Stay of action taken by Grievance Board; requests.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) A request for a stay shall be entertained only in conjunction with and as a part of an exception to an action taken by the Grievance Board under part 1425 of this subchapter. The filing of an exception shall not itself operate as a stay of the action involved in the proceedings.</P>
        <P>(b) A timely request for a stay of an action taken by the Grievance Board to which an exception has been filed shall operate as a temporary stay of the award. Such temporary stay shall be deemed effective from the date of the action and shall remain in effect until the Board issues its decision and order on the exception, or the Board or its designee otherwise acts with respect to the request for the stay.</P>
        <P>(c) A request for a stay of an action taken by the Grievance Board will be granted only where it appears, based upon the facts and circumstances presented, that:</P>
        <P>(1) There is a strong likelihood of success on the merits of the appeal; and</P>
        <P>(2) A careful balancing of all the equities, including the public interest, warrants issuance of a stay.</P>

When service is to be made to an addressee outside the United States, the date of service shall be the date received, as evidenced by official receipt.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Chapter XIV—Memorandum Describing the Authority and Assigned Responsibilities of the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority Under the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute</HD>
        <FP>The statutory authority and responsibility of the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Board are stated in section 4108 subsections (1), (2) and (3), of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute as follows:</FP>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section <E T="01">4108</E>
          <E T="04">Functions of the General Counsel</E>
        </HD>
        <P>The General Counsel may—</P>
        <P>(A) investigate alleged unfair labor practices under this chapter,</P>
        <P>(B) file and prosecute complaints under this chapter, and</P>
        <P>(C) exercise such other powers of the Board as the Board may prescribe.</P>
        <P>This memorandum is intended to describe the statutory authority and set forth the prescribed duties and authority of the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority under the Foreign Service Statute, effective February 15, 1981.</P>
        <P>I. <E T="03">Case handling—</E> A. <E T="03">Unfair labor practice cases.</E> The General Counsel has full and final authority and responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to accept and investigate charges filed, to enter into and approve the informal settlement of charges, to approve withdrawal requests, to dismiss charges, to determine matters concerning the consolidation and severance of cases before complaint issues, to issue complaints and notices of hearing, to appear before Administrative Law Judges in hearings on complaints and prosecute as provided in the Board's and the General Counsel's rules and regulations, and to initiate and prosecute injunction proceedings as provided for in section 4109(d) of the Foreign Service Statute. After issuance of the Administrative Law Judge's decision, the General Counsel may file exceptions and briefs and appear before the Board in oral argument, subject to the Board's and the General Counsel's rules and regulations.</P>
        <P>B. <E T="03">Compliance actions (injunction proceedings).</E> The General Counsel is authorized and responsible, on behalf of the Board, to seek and effect compliance with the Board's orders and make such compliance reports to the Board as it may from time to time require.
        </P>

        <FP>On behalf of the Board, the General Counsel will, in full accordance with the directions of the Board, initiate and prosecute injunction proceedings as provided in section 4109(d) of the Foreign Service Statute: <E T="03">Provided however,</E> That the General Counsel will initiate and conduct injunction proceedings under section 4109(d) of the Foreign Service Statute only upon approval of the Board.</FP>
        <P>C. <E T="03">Representation cases.</E> The General Counsel is authorized and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to receive and process, in accordance with the decisions of the Board and with such instructions and rules and regulations as may be issued by the Board from time to time, all petitions filed pursuant to sections 4111 and 4118(c) of the Foreign Service Statute. The General Counsel is also authorized and has responsibility to supervise or conduct elections pursuant to section 4111 of the Foreign Service Statute <PRTPAGE P="587"/>and to enter into consent election agreements in accordance with section 4111(g) of the Foreign Service Statute.
        </P>
        <FP>The authority and responsibility of the General Counsel in representation cases shall extend, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board and the General Counsel, to all phases of the investigation through the conclusion of the hearing (if a hearing should be necessary to resolve disputed issues), but all matters involving decisional action after such hearings are reserved by the Board to itself. In the event a direction of election should issue by the Board, the authority and responsibility of the General Counsel, as herein prescribed, shall attach to the conduct of the ordered election, the initial determination of the validity of challenges and objections to the conduct of the election and other similar matters, except that if appeals shall be taken from the General Counsel's action on the validity of challenges and objections, such appeals will be directed to and decided by the Board in accordance with its procedural requirements. If challenged ballots would not affect the election results and if no objections are filed within five days after the conduct of the Board-directed election under the provisions of section 4111 of the Foreign Service Statute, the General Counsel is authorized and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to certify to the parties the results of the election in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board and the General Counsel.</FP>
        
        <FP>Appeals from the refusal of the General Counsel to issue a notice of hearing, from the conclusions contained in a report and findings issued by the General Counsel, or from the dismissal by the General Counsel of any petition, will be directed to and decided by the Board, in accordance with its procedural requirements.</FP>
        
        <FP>In processing election petitions filed pursuant to section 4111 of the Foreign Service Statute and petitions filed pursuant to section 4118(c) of the Foreign Service Statute, the General Counsel is authorized to conduct an appropriate investigation as to the authenticity of the prescribed showing of interest and, upon making a determination to proceed, where appropriate, to supervise or conduct a secret ballot election or certify the validity of a petition for determination of eligibility for dues allotment. After an election, if there are no challenges or objections which require a hearing by the Board, the General Counsel shall certify the results thereof, with appropriate copies lodged in the Washington, DC, files of the Board.S8010</FP>
        <P>II. <E T="03">Liaison with other governmental agencies.</E> The General Counsel is authorized and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to maintain appropriate and adequate liaison and arrangements with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations with reference to the financial and other reports required to be filed with the Assistant Secretary pursuant to section 4117 of the Foreign Service Statute and the availability to the Board and the General Counsel of the contents thereof. The General Counsel is authorized and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to maintain appropriate and adequate liaison with the Foreign Service Grievance Board with respect to functions which may be performed by the Foreign Service Grievance Board.</P>
        <P>III. To the extent that the above-described duties, powers and authority rest by statute with the Board, the foregoing statement constitutes a prescription and assignment of such duties, powers and authority, whether or not so specified.</P>

          <P>(c) Immediately following the public announcement, the Foundation shall publish the announcement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(d) The <E T="03">earliest practicable time,</E> as used in this subsection, means as soon as possible, which should not be later than the commencement of the meeting or portion in question.</P>
          <P>(e) The Secretary of the Foundation shall use reasonable means to assure that the public is fully informed by the public announcements required by this section. Such public announcements may be made by posting notices in the public areas of the Foundation's headquarters and mailing notices to the persons on a list maintained for those who want to receive such announcements.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedure for closing meetings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Action to close a meeting or a portion thereof, pursuant to the exemptions set forth in § 1500.5, shall be taken only when:</P>

          <P>(1) A majority of the membership of the Foundation's Board of Directors votes to take such action. That vote shall determine whether or not any portion or portions of a meeting or portions of a series of meetings may be <PRTPAGE P="592"/>closed to public, obervation for any of the reasons provided in § 1500.5 and whether or not the public interest nevertheless requires that portion of the meeting or meetings remain open. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Board member participating in such vote shall be recorded, and no proxies shall be allowed.</P>
          <P>(2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Foundation close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in § 1500.5 (a) (5), (6), or (7), the Foundation, upon request of any one of its Board members, shall take a recorded vote whether to close such portion of the meeting.</P>
          <P>(b) Within one day of any vote taken, the Foundation shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote, reflecting the vote of each member on the question, and a full written explanation of the action to close a portion of or the entire meeting, together with a list of persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliations.</P>
          <P>(c) For every closed meeting, the General Counsel of the Foundation shall publicly certify prior to a Board of Directors’ vote on closing the meeting that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting and the persons present, shall be retained by the Foundation.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Changing the time and place of, and reconsideration of opening or closing a meeting.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The time or place of a Board meeting may be changed following the public announcement only if the Foundation publicly announces such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Foundation to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed following the public announcement only if a majority of the Board of Directors determines by a recorded vote that Foundation business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and the Foundation publicly announces such change and the vote of each member upon change at the earliest practicable time.</P>

          <P>(b) The Foundation, after review by the General Counsel, shall make promptly available to the public in a place easily accessible to the public the transcript or electronic recording of the discussion of any item on the agenda, or any item of the testimony of any witness received at the Board meeting, except for such item or items of discussion or testimony as the Foundation determines to contain information which may be withheld under §1500.5. Copies of such transcript, or a transcription of such recording, disclosing the identify of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription. The Foundation shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any Foundation proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.</P>

            <P>(c) The Board is also required to establish an Advisory Council made up of individuals knowledgeable about development activities in Africa, and to consult with the Council at least once each year. The Council shall have not more than 25 members appointed for a period of two years with an option to be reappointed for an additional year.</P>
            <P>(d) The Board of Directors and the aforementioned officers, together with the other employees of the Foundation, constitute the central organization of ADF, and are located and function at ADF headquarters, 1724 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036. It is anticipated that in the future a field organization will be established with offices in selected cities in Africa, but this has not yet occurred.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">When charged.</E> Fees shall be charged in accordance with the schedules contained in paragraph (b) of this section for services rendered in responding to requests for Foundation records under this sub-part unless the Director of A&amp;F determines that such charges, or a portion thereof, are not in the public interest because furnishing the information primarily benefits the general public. Fees shall also not be charged where they would amount, in the aggregate, for a request or series of related requests, to less than $3. Ordinarily, fees shall not be charged if the records requested are not found, or if located, are withheld as exempt.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Services charged for and amount charged.</E> For the services listed below expended in locating or making available records or copies thereof, the following charges shall be assessed:</P>

          <P>(2) <E T="03">Clerical searches.</E> For each one quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in excess of the first quarter hour in searching for and producing requested records, $2.30.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-routine, non-clerical searches.</E> Where the task of determining which records fall within a request and collecting them requires the time of professional or managerial personnel, and where the time required is substantial, for each one quarter hour spent in excess of the first quarter hour, $5.40. No charge shall be made for the time spent in resolving legal or policy issues affecting access to records of known contents.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> When a response to a request requires services or materials other than those described in paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section, the direct cost of such services to the Foundation may be charged, providing the requestor has been given an estimate of such cost before it is incurred.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Revision of schedule.</E> The fee schedule will be revised from time to time, without notice, to assure recovery of <PRTPAGE P="596"/>actual costs of rendering information services to any person. The revised schedule will be available without charge.</P>

          <P>(a) Records specifically required by executive order to be exempt from disclosure in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy which properly classified pursuant to such executive order;</P>
          <P>(b) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Foundation;</P>
          <P>(c) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552b), providing that such statute (1) requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion, or (2) establishes criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>
          <P>(d) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from any person which is privileged or confidential;</P>
          <P>(e) Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the Foundation;</P>
          <P>(f) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
          <P>(g) Investigatory files (including security investigation files and files concerning the conduct of employees) compiled for law enforcement purposes, except to the extent available by law to a private party.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Denials.</E> If the Director of A&amp;F, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, denies a request for records, the requestor will be informed of the name and title of the official responsible for the denial, the reasons for it, and the right to appeal the decision to the President of the Foundation within 15 working days of receipt of the denial. The President shall determine any appeal within 20 days of receipt and notify the requestor within the time period of the decision. If the decision is to uphold the denial, the requestor will be informed of the reasons for the decision and of the right to a judicial review of the decision in the federal courts.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided by law, the African Development Foundation will conduct administrative actions to collect claims (including offset, compromise, suspension, termination, disclosure and referral) in accordance with the Federal Claim Collection Standards (“FCCS”) of the General Accounting Office and Department of Justice, 4 CFR parts 101-105.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Late payment, penalty and administrative charges.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided by statute, loan agreement or contract, the African Development Foundation will assess:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Late payment charges</E> (interest) on unpaid claims at the prompt payment interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury as the current value of funds to the United States Treasury.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Penalty charges</E> at 6 percent a year on any portion of a claim that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Administrative charges</E> to cover the costs of processing and calculating delinquent claims.</P>
          <P>(b) Late payment charges shall be computed from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the notice of the claim and interest requirements.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> (1) Late payment charges are waived on any claim or any portion of a claim which is paid within 30 days after the date on which late payment charges begin to accrue.</P>

          <P>(2) The 30 day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis if it is determined that an extension is appropriate. <PRTPAGE P="599"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) The African Development Foundation may waive late payment, penalty and administrative charges under the FCCS criteria for the compromise of claims (4 CFR part 103), or upon a determination that collection of the charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of the United States, including for example:</P>
          <P>(i) Pending consideration of a request for reconsideration, administrative review or waiver under a permissive statute,</P>
          <P>(ii) If repayment of the full amount of the debt is made after the date upon which interest and other charges become payable and the estimated costs of recovering the residual balance exceeds the amount owed, or</P>
          <P>(iii) If collection of interest or other charges would jeopardize collection of the principal of the claim.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1506.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A total of three progressively stronger written demands at approximately 30-day intervals will normally be made, unless a response or other information indicates that additional written demands would either be unnecessary or futile. When necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, including immediate referral for litigation and/or offset.</P>
          <P>(b) The initial written demand for payment shall inform the debtor of:</P>
          <P>(1) The basis for the claim;</P>
          <P>(2) The amount of the claim;</P>
          <P>(3) The date when payment is due, 30 days, from date of mailing or hand delivery of the intial demand for payment;</P>
          <P>(4) The provision for late payment (interest), penalty and administrative charges, if payment is not received by the due date.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1506.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Collection by offset.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Collection by administrative offset will be undertaken only on claims which are liquidated or certain in amount. Offset will be used whenever feasible and not otherwise prohibited. Offset is not required to be used in every instance and consideration should be given to the debtor's financial condition and the impact of offset on Foundation activities.</P>
          <P>(b) The procedures for offset in this part do not apply to the offset of Federal salaries under 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>
          <P>(c) Before offset is made, the Foundation will provide the debtor with written notice informing the debtor of:</P>
          <P>(1) The nature and amount of the claim;</P>
          <P>(2) The intent of the Foundation to collect by administrative offset, including asking the assistance of the other Federal agencies to help in the offset whenever possible, if the debtor has not made payment by the payment due date or has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due data;</P>
          <P>(3) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the Foundation related to the claim;</P>
          <P>(4) The right of the debtor to a review of the claim within the Foundation. If the claim is disputed in full or part, the debtor shall respond to the demand in writing by making a request to the billing office for a review of the claim within the Foundation by the payment due date stated in the notice. The debtor's written response shall state the basis for the dispute. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion must be paid by the date stated in the notice to avoid late payment, penalty and administrative charges. If the African Development Foundation later sustains or amends its determination, it shall notify the debtor of its intent to collect the claim, with any adjustments based on the debtor's response, by administrative offset, unless payment is received within 30 days of the mailing of the notification of its decision following a review of the claim.</P>
          <P>(5) The right of the debtor to offer to make a written agreement to repay the amount of the claim.</P>
          <P>(6) The notice of offset need not include the requirements of paragraph (c) (3), (4) or (5) of this section if the debtor has been informed of the requirements at an earlier stage in the administrative proceedings, e.g., if they were included in a final contracting officer's decision.</P>

          <P>(d) The African Development Foundation will promptly make requests for <PRTPAGE P="600"/>offset to other agences known to be holding funds payable to a debtor and, when appropriate, place the name of the debtor on the “List of Contractors Indebted to the United States.” The African Development Foundation will provide instructions to the collecting agency for the transfer of funds.</P>
          <P>(e) The African Development Foundation will promptly process requests for offset from other agencies and transfer funds to the requesting Foundation upon receipt of the written certification required by § 102.3 of the FCCS.</P>

          <P>(b) The African Development Foundation may enter into contracts with collection agencies in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718 and the FCCS.</P>

          <P>The purpose of this part is to set forth the basic policies of the African Development Foundation (“the Foundation” or “ADF”) governing the maintenance of systems of records containing personal information as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).</P>

          <SUBJECT>General policies.</SUBJECT>
          <P>It is the policy of the Foundation to safeguard the right of privacy of any individual as to whom the Foundation maintains personal information in any records system, and to provide such individuals with appropriate and complete access to such records, including adequate opportunity to correct any errors in said records. It is further the policy of the Foundation to maintain its records in such a fashion that the information contained therein is, and remains, material and relevant to the purposes for which it is collected.

          <SUBJECT>Accounting for disclosure of records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) With respect to each system of records under ADF control, the Foundation will keep an accurate accounting of routine disclosures, except those made to employees of the Foundation in the normal course of duties or pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Such accounting shall contain the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The date, nature and purpose of each disclosure, and the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made:</P>
          <P>(2) Sufficient information to permit the construction of a listing of all disclosures at appropriate periodic intervals; and</P>
          <P>(3) The justification or basis upon which any release was made including any written documentation required.</P>

          <P>(b) The Foundation will retain the accounting made under this section for at least 5 years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made.<PRTPAGE P="602"/>
          </P>
          <P>(c) Except for disclosure made under paragraph (g) of § 1503.3, the Foundation will make the accounting under paragraph (a) of this section available to the individual named in the record at his or her request.</P>
          <P>(d) The Foundation will inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1507.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Access to records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided by law or regulation, any individual, upon request made either in writing or in person during regular business hours, shall be provided access to his or her record or to any information pertaining to him or her which is contained in a system of records maintained by the Foundation. The individual will be permitted to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him or her. Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a, however, allows an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
          <P>(b) An individual will be notified, upon request, if any Foundation system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her. Such request may be made in person during regular business hours, or in writing over the signature of the person making the request. Individuals requesting the information will be required to identify themselves by providing their names, addresses, and a signature. If they are requesting disclosure in person, they are also required to show an identification card, such as a drivers license, containing a photo and a sample signature. If the request is received through the mail, the Foundation may request such information as may be necessary to assure that the requesting individual is properly identified. This may include a requirement that the request be notarized with a notation that the notary received an acknowledgement of identity from the requester.</P>
          <P>(c) A record may be disclosed to a representative of the person to whom a record relates when the representative is authorized in writing by such person to have access.</P>
          <P>(d) Requests for access to or copies of records should contain, at a minimum, identifying information needed to locate any given record, and a brief description of the item or items of information required. If the individual wishes access to specific documents, the request should identify or describe, as nearly as possible, such documents. The request should be made to the Director, Administration and Finance, African Development Foundation, 1625 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Suite 600, Washington, DC 20036. Personal contacts should normally be made during the regular duty hours of the officer concerned, which are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.</P>
          <P>(e) A request made in person will be promptly complied with if the records sought are in the immediate custody of the Foundation. Mail or personal requests for documents which are not in the immediate custody of ADF or which are otherwise not immediately available, will be acknowledged within ten working days of receipt, and the records will be provided as promptly thereafter as possible.</P>
          <P>(f) Special procedures may be established by the President of the Foundation governing the disclosure to an individual of his or her medical records, including psychological records.</P>
          <P>(g) Any individual may request the Director, Administration and Finance, to amend any Foundation record pertaining to him or her. Not later than 10 working days after the date of receipt of such request, the Director, Administration and Finance, or his/her designee, will acknowledge such receipt in writing. Promptly after acknowledging receipt of a request, the Director, Administration and Finance or his/her designee will:</P>
          <P>(1) Correct any portion of the record which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete; or</P>

          <P>(2) Inform the individual of the Foundation's refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request, the reason for the refusal, the procedures by which the individual may request a review of that refusal by the President of the Foundation, or his/her designee, <PRTPAGE P="603"/>and the name and address of such official; or</P>
          <P>(3) Refer the request to the agency that has control of and maintains the record when the record requested is not the property of the Foundation, but of the controlling agency.</P>
          <P>(h) Any individual who disagrees with the refusal of the Director, Administration and Finance to amend his or her record may request a review of that refusal. Such request for review must be made within 30 days after receipt by the requester of the initial refusal to amend. The President of the Foundation, or designee, will complete such review not later than 30 working days from the date on which the individual requests such review, and make a final determination, unless for good cause shown, the President or designee extends such 30-day period and notifies the requester in writing that additional time is required to complete the review. If, after review, the President or designee refuses to amend the record in accordance with the request, the individual will be advised of the right to file with the Foundation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal, and also advised of the provisions in the Act for judicial review of the President's determination.</P>
          <P>(i) In any disclosure containing information about which the individual has filed a statement under paragraph (g) of this section, the Foundation will clearly note any part of the record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement and, if the Foundation deems it appropriate, copies of a concise statement of the Foundation's reasons for not making the amendment requested, to persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record has been disclosed.</P>

          <P>(7) The Foundation's procedures whereby an individual can be notified at his or her request if the system or systems of records contains a record pertaining to him or her;</P>

          <P>(9) The categories of sources of records in the system or systems.</P>
          <P>(e) All records used by the Foundation in making any determination about any individual will be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.</P>
          <P>(f) Before disseminating any record about an individual to any person other than an agency or pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552, the Foundation will make reasonable efforts to assure that such records are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for Foundation purposes.</P>
          <P>(g) The Foundation will maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained, or unless pertinent to, and within the scope of, an authorized law enforcement activity.</P>
          <P>(h) The Foundation will establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of any system of records, or in maintaining any record.

The instruction will include any other rules and procedures adopted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the penalties provided for noncompliance.</P>
          <P>(i) The Foundation will establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.</P>
            <P>(b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under section 6 of the E.O. by:</P>
            <P>(1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the governmentwide system;</P>
            <P>(2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;</P>
            <P>(3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of “ineligible” in § 1508.105), and participants who have voluntarily excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;</P>
            <P>(4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and</P>
            <P>(5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.</P>
            <P>(c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by—</P>
            <P>(1) Providing for the inclusion in the <E T="03">List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs</E> all persons proposed for debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons determined to be ineligible; and</P>
            <P>(2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.</P>

            <P>(d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible participants <PRTPAGE P="607"/>and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.</P>

For purposes of these regulations such transactions will be referred to as “covered transactions.”</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Covered transaction.</E> For purposes of these regulations, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Primary covered transaction.</E> Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: Grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban <PRTPAGE P="609"/>Development in such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lower tier covered transaction.</E> A lower tier covered transaction is:</P>
            <P>(A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a primary covered transaction.</P>
            <P>(B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary covered transaction.</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Providers of federally-required audit services.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The following transactions are not covered:</P>
            <P>(i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;</P>
            <P>(ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;</P>
            <P>(iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);</P>
            <P>(iv) Federal employment;</P>
            <P>(v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters;</P>
            <P>(vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations would be prohibited by law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Relationship to other sections.</E> This section describes the types of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations will apply. subpart B, “Effect of Action,” § 1508.200, “Debarment or suspension,” sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities described in § 1508.110(a). Sections 1508.325, “Scope of debarment,” and 1508.420, “Scope of suspension,” govern the extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a participant would be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Relationship to Federal procurement activities.</E> In accordance with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or suspension under the FAR.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are appropriate means to implement this policy.</P>

            <P>(b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection and not <PRTPAGE P="610"/>for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in these regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.</P>

            <P>(2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or under a no-cost time extension of such a grant.

            <P>(c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this statewide certification in its Governor's office and, prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central location for submission.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.</P>

            <P>(2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of this State agency-wide certification in its central <PRTPAGE P="620"/>office and, prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central location for submission.</P>
            <P>(3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those located in other State agencies.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which performance is expected to be completed.</P>
            <P>(2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days after award.</P>

            <P>(1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.</P>
            <P>(2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was convicted.</P>
            <P>(i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.</P>
            <P>(b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notices.

            <P>1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary participant is providing the certification set out below.</P>
            <P>2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person from participation in this transaction.</P>
            <P>3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default.</P>

            <P>4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted <PRTPAGE P="621"/>or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</P>
            <P>5. The terms <E T="03">covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded</E>, as used in this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.</P>
            <P>6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or agency entering into this transaction.</P>
            <P>7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting this proposal that it will include the clause titled “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transaction,” provided by the department or agency entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered transactions.</P>
            <P>8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.</P>
            <P>9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</P>
            <P>10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default.</P>

            <P>(a) Are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded by any Federal department or agency;</P>
            <P>(b) Have not within a three-year period preceding this proposal been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State or local) transaction or contract under a public transaction; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property;</P>
            <P>(c) Are not presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (1)(b) of this certification; and</P>
            <P>(d) Have not within a three-year period preceding this application/proposal had one or more public transactions (Federal, State or local) terminated for cause or default.</P>

The prospective lower tier participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or agency with which this transaction originated.</P>
            <P>6. The prospective lower tier participant further agrees by submitting this proposal that it will include this clause titled “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transaction,” without modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered transactions.</P>
            <P>7. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from covered transactions, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.</P>
            <P>8. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</P>
            <P>9. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.</P>

            <P>(1) The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by submission of this proposal, that neither it nor its principals is presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction by any Federal department or agency.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the prospective lower tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, such prospective participant shall attach an explanation to this proposal.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Instructions for Certification</HD>
            <P>1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, the grantee is providing the certification set out below.</P>
            <P>2. The certification set out below is a material representation of fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-Free Workplace Act.</P>
            <P>3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.</P>
            <P>4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.</P>
            <P>5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on file in its office and make the information available for Federal inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.</P>

            <P>6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under <PRTPAGE P="623"/>the grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).</P>
            <P>7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see paragraph five).</P>
            <P>8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this certification. Grantees’ attention is called, in particular, to the following definitions from these rules:</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1510.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1510.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or <PRTPAGE P="628"/>activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General</E>. The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1510.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1510.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1510.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1600.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

        <SECTION>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1600.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods—</E>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the <PRTPAGE P="636"/>agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1600.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1600.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>

          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.<PRTPAGE P="637"/>
          </P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1600.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.</P>
          <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>

Although the USIP does not believe that Congress contemplated coverage of independent Federal institutions, such as the USIP, it has chosen to promulgate this part.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1701.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance <PRTPAGE P="644"/>with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1701.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1701.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by January 24, 1994, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by November 26, 1996, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by May 26, 1994, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>

          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by <PRTPAGE P="645"/>telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1701.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
