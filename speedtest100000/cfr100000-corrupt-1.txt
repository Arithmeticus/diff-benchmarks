Thus, 22 CFR 1.1 refers to title 22, part 1, section 𐥀. Explanation The C𐥔de of Federal Regulation𐥭 is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bea𐪞 the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Ea𐬔h volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: Tit𐮓e 1 through Title 16 as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27 as of April𐯞1 Title 28 through Title 41 as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50 as of October 1 The appropriate revisi𐱈n date is printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be𐲼judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations is𐶟kept up to 𐶫𐶬te by the indi𐶻idual issues of the Federa𐷖 Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Aff𐻒cte𐻖 (LSA),” wh𐻢ch is issued m𐻱nthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volu𑁩e of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the u𑅢er in determining the actual effective date. In instances 𑆝here the effective date i𑆷 beyond the c𑇅t-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the fu𑈈ure effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS T𑋙e Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with the𑍐r information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These 𑏬MB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE Provi𑑴ions of the Code that are no longer in force and eff𑒩ct as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by u𑕐ing the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sect𑗀ons Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. 𑗻or changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to𑚂the 𑚇ode prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-19𑛾5, and 1986-2000. “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY The term “[Reserved]” is𑝂used 𑝈s a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An ag𑞇ncy may ad𑞒 regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is us𑟲d editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not a𑡀cidentally dropped due to a printing or𑡨computer error. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was establishe𑣡 by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other 𑪘roperly issued regulation, has the force 𑫂f law. What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requ𑭙rements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on w𑮕ich approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and sub𑳖itted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road,𑻓College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

These regulations provide basic standards for emp𗕉oyees o𗕑 the Department of State, the United States International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA), the Agency for International Development (AID), and the International Co𗗻munication Agency (USICA), their spouses (unless separated) and their dependents to accept and retain gifts and decorations from foreign governments. § 3.2 Authority. (a) Section 515(a)(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act 𗛤f 1978 (91 Stat. 862-866), approved𗜈August 17, 1977, (hereafter referred to as “the Act”) amended section 7342 of title 5, U.S. Code (1976), making substantial changes in the 𗞔aw relating to the acceptance and retention of gifts and decorations from foreign governments. (b) 5 U.S.C. 7342(g) 𗠉uthorizes each employing agency to prescribe regulations as necessary to carry out the new law. § 3.3 Definitions. When used in this part, the following terms have the me𗢴nings indicated: (a) Employee means (1) an officer or employee of the Department, AID, IDCA, or USICA, including an expert or consultant, however appointed, and (2) a spouse (unless separated) or a dependent of such a person,𗦖as def𗦝ned in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1𗧢2). (b) Foreign government means: (1) Any unit of foreign governmental authority, including any foreign national, St𗩗te, local, or municipal government; (2) any international or multinational org𗪦nization whose membership is composed of any unit of foreign government as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; (3) any agent or representative of any such unit or organization, while acting as such; (c) Gift means a tangible or intangible present (other than a decoration) tender𗯉d by, or received from, a foreign government; (d) Decoration means an order, device, medal, badge, insignia, emblem or award tendered by, or received from, a foreign government; (e𗱾 Minimal value means𗲓retail value in the United States at the time of acceptance of $100 or less, except that on January 1, 1981, and𗴄at 3-year intervals thereafter, “minimal value” is to be redefined in regulations prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, in consultat𗶘on with the Secretary of State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the immediately preceding 3-year period. § 3.4 Restriction on acceptance 𗸵f gifts a𗸿d decorations. (a) An employee is prohibited from requesting or otherwise encouraging the tender of a gift or decoration from a foreign government.𗻓An employee is also prohibited from accepting a gift or decoration from a f𗼟reign government, except in accordance with these regulations. (b) An employee may accept and retain a gift of minimal 𗾗alue tendered and received as a souvenir or mark of courtesy, subject, however, to the following rest𗿽ictions— (1) Where more than one tangible item is included in a single presentation, the entire presentation shall be𘁳considered as one gift, and the aggregate value of all items ta𘂳en together must not exceed “minimal value”. (2) The donee is responsible for determining that a gift is of m𘄡nimal value in the United States at the time of acceptance. However, should any dispute result from a𘆇difference of opinion concerning the value of a gift, t𘆿e employing agency will secure the se𘇥vices of an outside appraiser to establish whether the gift is one of “minimal value”. If, after an appraisal has𘉗been made, it is established that the value of the gift in question is $200 or more at retail in 𘊹he United States, 𘋌he donee will bear the costs of the appraisal. If, however, the appraised value is established to be less than $2𘌾𘌿, the employing agency will bear the costs. (c) An employee may accept a gift of more than minimal value when (1) such gift is in the nature of𘏏an educational scholarship or medical treatment, or (2) it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United 𘒙tates, ex𘒣ept t𘒩at a tangible gift of more than minimal value is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States and, upo𘔟 acceptance, shall become the 𘔾roperty of the Un𘕐ted States. (d) An employee may accept gif𘕻s of travel or expenses for travel taking place𘖫entirely outside the United States (such as transp𘗞rtation, food, and lodging) of more than𘘇m𘘉nimal value if such acceptance is appropriate, consistent with the interests of the United States, and permitted by the employing agency. Except where the employ𘚫ng agency has specific inte𘛇ests which may be favorably affected by employee travel wholly outside the United States, even though it would not normally authorize its employees t𘝝 engage in such travel, the standards no𘞆mally applied to determine when proposed travel will be in the best interests of the 𘟜mploying agency and of the United States Government shall be applied in approving acceptance of travel or travel ex𘡐enses offered by a foreign government. (1) There are two circumstances under which employees may accept gifts of travel or expenses: (i) When the employee is issued official travel orders placing him or her in the positio𘤮 of accepti𘤺g travel or travel expenses offered by a for𘥧ign government which are directly related to the authorized purpose of the travel; or (ii𘧁 When the employee's travel orders specifically anticipate the acceptance of additional travel and𘨤travel expenses incident to the authorized travel. (2) When an employee is traveling under circu𘪅stances described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of𘪱this section, th𘫂t is, without specific instructions authorizing acceptance of additional travel expens𘬙s from a𘬢foreign government, the employee must file a report with the employing angency under the procedures prescribed in § 3.6. (e) Since tangible gifts of more than minimal value may not lawfully become the personal property o𘯿 the donee, all supervisory officials 𘰦hall, in advising employees of their responsibil𘱗ties under the regulations, impress upon them thei𘲊 obligation to decline acceptance of such gifts, whenever possible, at the time𘳚they are offered, or to return them if they have been sent or delivered without a𘴬prior offer. All practical measures, such as per𘵝odic briefings, shall be taken to minimize the number of gifts which employees must deposit and which thus become subject to disposal as provided by law and regulation. Employees should not accept gifts of more than minimal value on th𘹉 assumption that refusal would be likely to “cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations 𘻊f the United States”. In many instances it should be possible, by explanation of the prohibition against an employee's retention of such gifts, to avoid consequences of acceptance, including possible𘾒return of the gift to the 𘾭onor. Refusal of the gift at the inception should typically be regarded as in the interest both of the foreign government donor and the U.S. Government. § 3.5 Designation of officials and office𙁰 responsible for administration of foreign gifts and decoratio𙂯s. (a) The Act effects a signifi𙃐ant degree of decentralization of 𙃳dministration relative to the disposal 𙄛f foreign𙄥gifts and decorations which become U.S. Government property. Each agency is now responsible for receiving from its employees deposits of foreign gifts of more than minimal value, as well as of foreign decorations not meeting the statutory criter𙈛a for retention by the recipient. The agency is also responsible for disposing of this property by return to the donor, for re𙊚aining it in the agency if official use of it is approved, for reporting to the General Services Administration within 30 calendar days after deposit items neither disposed of nor retained, and for assuming custody, proper care and handling of such 𙎔roperty pending removal from that custody pursuant to disposal arr𙏗ngements b𙏢 the General Services Administration. The Secretary of State, however, is made responsible for providing guidance to other executive agencies in the development of their own regulations to implement the𙒭Act, as well as for the annual𙓌publication of lists of all gifts of more than minimal value deposited by Federal employees during the preceding year. [See § 3.5(c).] Authority for the discharge of the Secreta𙕾y's responsibilities is delegated by these regulations to the Chief of Protocol. (b) The 𙗘ffice of the Chief of Protocol retains primary responsibi𙘒ity for administration of the Act within the Department of State. That Office will, 𙙧owever, serve as the depository only for those foreign gifts and decorations which are turned in by State Department employees. The Director of Personnel Services of the USICA will have responsibility for administration of the Act within that agency and 𙝦ill serve as the depository of foreign gifts and decorations. Employees of the other foreign affa𙟈rs agencies must deposit with their respective agencies any gifts or decorations deposit of which is required by law. (c) Any questions concerning the implementation of these regulations or interpretation of the law should be directed to the following: (1) For the Department of S𙣡ate, to the Office of Protocol or to the Office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Management, as appropriate; (2) For IDCA, to𙥡the Office of 𙥰𙥱e General Counsel; (3) For AID, to the Assistant General Counsel for Employee and Public Affairs; and (4) For USICA, to the General Counsel. § 3.6 Procedure to be followed by employees in depositing gifts of more than minimal value and reporting acceptance of travel or travel expenses. (a) An employee who has accepted a𙪳tangible gift of mor𙫈 than minimal value shall, within 60 days after acceptance, relinquish it 𙬓o the designated depository office for the employing agency for disposal or, with the approval of that office, deposit it for official use at a designated location in the employing agency or at a specified Foreign Service post. The designated depository offices are: (1) For the Department of State, the Office of Protocol; (2) For IDCA, the General Services Division of the Offic𙲐 of Management Planning in AID; (3) For AID, the General Services Division of the Office of Management Planning; and (4) For USICA𙴓 the Office of Personnel Services. (b) At the time that an employee deposits gifts of more than minimal value for disposal or for official use pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or within 30 days after accepting a gift of travel or travel expe𙸏ses as provided in § 3.4(d) (unless th𙸶 𙸸ift 𙸽f such travel or travel expenses has been accepted in accordance with specific instructions from the Department or agency), the em𙻀loyee shall file a statement with the designated depository office with the following information: (1) For each tangible gift re𙽁orted: (i) The name and position of the employee; (ii) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justifying acceptance; (iii) 𙿌he identity of the foreign g𙿩vernment and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift; (iv) The date of acceptance of the gift; (v) The donee's best estima𚁻e in specific dollar terms of the value of the gift in the United States at the time of acceptance; and (vi) Disposition or current location of the gift. (For State Department employees, forms for this purpose are availab𚅙e in the Office of Protocol.) (2) For each gift of travel or travel expenses: (i) The name and position of the em𚇋loyee; (ii) A brief description𚇫of the gift and the circumstances justifying acceptance; and (iii) The identity of the foregign government and the name and posi𚉬ion of the individual who presented the gift. (c) The information contained in the statements 𚋋alled 𚋒or in paragraph 𚋣b) of this section is needed to comply with the statutory requirement that, not later than Janaury 31 of each year, the Secretary of State publish in the Federal Registe𚎍 a comprehensive listing of all such statements filed by Federal employees concerning gifts of more than min𚏺mal value𚐄received by them during the pr𚐣𚐤eding year. § 3.7 Decorations. (a) Decorations tendered in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or a𚒥arded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance may be ac𚓰epted, retained, and worn by an employee, subject to the approval of the employing agency. Without such approval, the decoration is deeme𚕺 to have been accepted on behalf of the United States and, like tangible gifts of more tha𚗕 minimal value, must be deposited by the employee w𚘉th the designated depository office for the employing agency within sixty days after acceptan𚙧e, for retention for official use or for disposal in accordance with § 3.9. (b) The de𚚾ision as to whether a deco𚛙ation has been awarded for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance will be made:𚜳(1) For the Department of State, by the supervising Assistant Secretary of State or 𚞈omparable official, except that, in the case of a decoration awarded to an Assistant Secretary or other officer of comparable or higher rank, the decision shall be mad𚠰 by the Office of Protocol; (2) 𚡑or IDCA, by the Assistant Directo𚡳 for Administration; (3) For AID, by the Director of Personnel Management; and (4) For USICA, by the S𚣚pe𚣝vising Associate Director, the General Counsel, or the Director of the Of𚤧ice of Congressional and P𚥂blic Liaison (for domestic employees), and by𚥰the Director of Area Offices (for overseas employees). (c) To justify an affirmative decision𚧎 a statement 𚧜rom the foreign gove𚧱nment, preferably in the form of a citation which shows the specific basis for the tender of the award, should be supplied. An employee who has received or been tendered a decoration should forward to the des𚫂gnated depository office of the emplo𚫨ing agency a request fo𚬀 review of the case. This request should contain a statement of circum𚭇tances of the award and such documentat𚭯on from the foreign government as has accom𚮛anied it. The depository office will obtain𚯇the decision of the cognizant office as to whether 𚯻he award meets the statutory criteria and thus 𚰫hether the decoration may be retained and worn. Pending receipt of that dec𚱷sion, the decoration should remain in the custody of the recipient. § 3.𚳀 Approval of retention of gifts or decorations with𚳴employing agency for official use. (a) At the request of an overseas post or an office within the employing agency, a gift or decoration deemed to have been accepted on behalf 𚶥f the United States may be retained for official u𚷘e. Suc𚷟𚷠retention should be approved: (1) For the Department of State, by the Chief of Protocol; (2) 𚸾or IDCA, by AID's Director of Management Operations; (3) For AID, by the Director of Management Operations; and 𚺯4) For USICA, by the Associate𚻎Director for Managemen𚻥. However, to qualify for such𚼄approval, the gift or decoration should be an item which can be used in the normal conduct of 𚽣gency𚽩business, such as a rug or a tea 𚾋ervice, or an art object meriting display, such as a painting or sculpture. Personal gift items, such as wristwatches, jewelry, or wearing apparel, should not be regarded as suitable 𛁃or “official use”. Only under unusual circumstances will retention of a decoration for official use be authorized. Every effort should be made to place each “official use” item in a location that will affo𛄑d the largest number of employees, and, if feasible, members of the public, the maximum opportunity to receive the benefit of it𛆒 display, provided the security of the l𛆻cation is adequate. (b) Items approved for official use must be acc𛇿unted for and safegua𛈕ded as Federal property at all times under s𛉂andard Federal property management procedures. Within 30 days after the official use of a gift has been termin𛊱ted, the gift or decoration shall be deposited with the designated depository office of the employing agency to be held pending completion of disposal arrangements by the General Services Administration. § 3.9 Disposal of gifts and decorations which become the property of the United States. (a) Gifts and decorations which have been repo𛐄ted to an employing agency shall either be returned to the donor or kept in safe𛑕stor𛑚ge pending receipt of instructions from the General Services Administration for transfer, donation or other disposal under the provisions of the Fede𛓰al Property and 𛔁dministrative Services Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 𛔯77, as amended, and the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 CFR part 101-49). The employing agency shall examine each gift or decoration and the circumstances surrounding its donation and assess whether any adverse effect upon the foreign relations of the United States might𛙋result from a return of the gift (or decoration) to the donor, which shall be the preferred means of disposal. If this is not de𛛌med feasible, the employing agency is require𛛺 by GSA re𛜅ulations to report 𛜙eposit of the gift or decoration within 30𛝄calendar days, using Standard Form 120, Report of Excess Personal Property and, as necessary, Standard Form 120A, Continuation Sheet, and citing section 7342 of title 𛟬, U.S. Code (1976), on the reporting document. Such reports shall be submitted to the General Services Administration, Washington National Capital Region (WDPO), Attention: Federal Property Resources Service, Seventh and D Streets, SW., Washington, DC 20407. (b) No gift or decoration deposited with the General Servic𛤫s Administration for disposal may be sold without the approval of the Se𛥴r𛥶tary of State, upon a determination that the sale will not adver𛦷ely affect the foreign rel𛧒tions of the United States. Wh𛧱n depositing gifts or decorations with the designated depository office of t𛨾eir employing agency, employees may indicate their interes𛩹 in participating in any subsequent sale of the items by the Government. Before gifts and decorations may be considered for sale by the General Services Administration, however, they must first have been offered for transfer𛭚to Federal agencies and for donation to the States. Consequently, employees should understand that there is no assurance that an item will be𛯨offered for sale, or, if so offered, that it will be feasible for an employee to participate in the sale. Employees are reminded in this conn𛱶ction𛱼that the primary aim of the Act is to discourage employees'𛲸acceptance of gifts of more than minimal value. § 3.10 Enf𛳳rcement. (a) Eac𛴄 employing agency is responsible under th𛴮 Act for reporting to the Attorney General cases in which there is reason to believe that one of its employees has violated the 𛶯ct. The Attorney 𛷁eneral in turn may file a civil action in𛷫any United States District Court against any Federal employee who has knowingly solicited or accepted a gift from a foreign government in violation of the Act, or who has failed to deposit or report such gift, as an Act required by the Act. In such case, the court may assess a maximum penality of the retail value of a gift improperly solicited or received, plus $5,000. (b) Supervisory officials at all levels within employing agencies shall be responsible for providing periodic reorientation of all employe𛿪s under their supervision on the basic features 𜀛f the Act 𜀦nd these regulations, and for ensuring that those employees observe the requirements for timely reporting and deposit of any gifts of more than minimal value they may have accepted. (c) Employees are advised of the following actions which may result from f𜄧ilure to comply with the requirements of the Act and these regulations: (1) Any supervisor who has substantial reason to believe that an employee under his 𜇄r her supervisio𜇕 has violated the reporting or other compliance provisions of the Act shall report the facts and circumstances in writing to the senior official in charge of administration within the cognizant bureau or office 𜊩r at the post abroad. If that official upon investigation decides that an employee who is the donee of a gift or is the recipient of travel or travel expenses has, through actions 𜍞ithin the employee's control, failed to 𜎇omply with the𜎖procedures established by the Act and these regulations, the case shall be referred to𜏭the Attorney General for appropriate action. (2) 𜐟n cases of confirmed evidence of a violation, whether or not such violation 𜑬esults in the taking of action by the Attorney General, the senior𜒯administrative official referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 𜓸s responsible for forwarding a violation report to the Attorney General shall institute appropriate disciplinary action against an employee who has failed to (i) Deposit tangible gifts within 60 days after acceptance,𜗒(ii) account properly for the acceptance of travel expenses or (iii) comply with the Act's requirements respecting disposal of gifts and decorations retained for official use. (3) In cases where there is confirmed evidence of a violation, but no evidence that the violation was willful on the part of the employee, the senior administrative official referred to in paragraph (𜝋)(1) o𜝒 this section shall institute appropriate disciplinary action of a lesser degree than that cal𜞱ed for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section in order to deter future vio𜟹ations by the same or another employee. § 3.11 Responsibility of chief of mission to inform host government of restrictions on employees' receipt of gi𜢑ts and decorations. A special provision of the A𜣂t requires the 𜣒resident to direct every chief of a U𜣸ited States diplomatic mission to inform the host government that it is a general policy of the Unit𜥝d States G𜥨vernment to prohibit its employees from receiving gifts of more than minimal value or decorations that have not bee𜧜 tendered “in recognition of active fi𜨃ld service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.” Accordingly, all Chiefs of Mission sha𜪚l in January of each year conduct a thorough and explicit program of orientation aimed at appropriate officials of the 𜬒ost government concerning the operation of th𜭀 Act. § 3.12 Exemption of grants and other foreign government assistance in cultural exchange programs from coverage of foreign gifts and decorations legislation. The Act specifically excludes from its application 𜰗rants and other forms of assistance “to whic𜱄 section 108A of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 applies”. See 22 U.S.C. 2558 (a) and (b) for the terms and conditions under which Congress consents to the acceptance by a Federal employee of grants and other forms of assistance provided by a foreign government to facilitate th𜵴 participation of such employee in a cultural exchange.

Source: 79 FR 35936, June 25, 2014, unless otherwise noted. § 9.1 Basis. The regulations in this𡨕par𡨙, taken together with 32 CFR part 2001 and Volume 5 of the Department's Foreign Affairs Manual, provide the basis for the sec𡪗rity classification program of the U.S. Depa𡫄tment of State (“the Department”) implementing Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security Infor𡬯ation (“the Executive Order” or “the Order”). § 9.2 Objective. The objective of the Departme𡮌t's classification program is to ensure that national security information is protected from unauthorized dis𡯺losure, but that it remains classified only to the extent and for such a pe𡱆iod as is necessary. § 9.3 Senior agenc𡱮 official. The Executive Order requires that each agency that originates or handles classified information designate a Senior Agency Official to direct and administer its information security program. The Department's senior agency official is the Under Se𡵯retary of State for Management. The Senior Agency Official is assisted in carrying out the𡷊p𡷌ovisions of the Executive Order and the Department's inf𡸅rmation security program by the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, the 𡹗ssistant Secre𡹦ary for Administration, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Information𡺸Services. § 9.4 𡻉riginal classification. (a) Definitio𡻯𡻰 Original classification is the𡼐initial determination that certain information requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security (i.e., national defense or foreign relations of the United States), together with a designation of the level of classification. (b) Classification levels. (1) Top Secret shall be applied to information the una𢁪thorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or desc𢄨ibe. (2) Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected t𢆜 cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to ident𢈇fy or describe. (3) Confidential shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected t𢊌 cause damage to the nationa𢊩 security th𢊶𢊷 the original classifica𢋐ion authorit𢋝 is able to identify or describe. (c) Classification r𢌔quirements and considerations. (1) Information may not be considered for classification unless its unauthorized disclosure could rea𢎙onably 𢎡e expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security in accordance with section 1.2 of the Executive Order, and it pertains to one or more of the following: (i) Military plans, weapons systems, or ope𢒅atio𢒊s; (ii) Foreign government information; (iii) Intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology; (iv) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources; (v) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security; (vi) United States 𢗨overnment programs 𢗼or safe𢘄uarding nuclear materials or facilities; (vii) Vulnerabiliti𢙁s or capabil𢙎ties of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the national security; or (viii) The development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction. (2) In classifying info𢜰mation, the public's interest in access to government information must be balanced against the need to𢞗protect national security information. (3) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause 𢠖amage to national security. (d) Classification lim𢡉tations and prohibitions. (1) In no case shall information be classified 𢢓n order to 𢢟onceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administ𢣓ative error, or to preve𢣬t embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency, to restrain competition, or to prevent or delay the release of information tha𢥱 does not require protection in the 𢦖nterest of the national security. (2) A reference to classified documents that does not directl𢧶 or indirectly disclose classified information may not be classified or used as a𢩈basis for classification. (3𢩥 Only information 𢩸wned 𢩾y, produced by or for, or und𢪜r the control of the U.S. Government may be ori𢫌inally classified. (e) Duration of classification.𢫿(1) Informatio𢬎 shall be classified for as long as is require𢬽 by national security considerations, subject to the limitations set forth in section𢮓1.5 of the Executive Order. When it can be determined, a speci𢯒ic date or event for declassification in less than 10 years shall be set by the𢰢original classification authority at the t𢱍me the information is originally classified. If a spe𢲃ific da𢲋e or event for declassification cannot 𢲳e determined, information shall be marked for decla𢳧sification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification fo𢶶 up to𢶽25 𢷁ears from the date of the original decision except for: (i) Information that would reveal the identity of a conf𢸲dential human source or a human intelligence sou𢹣ce, or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, in 𢺢hich case the duration of classification shall be up to 75 years and shall be designated w𢻽th the markings “50X1-HUM” and “50X2-WMD,” respectively; and (ii) Specific information inco𢽙porated into t𢽨e 𢽫lassification guide under section 2.2(e) of the Executive Order relating to exemptions from automatic declassification. (2) An original classifica𢿾ion author𣀉ty may extend the duration of classification up to 25 years from the da𣁑e o𣁕 origin of the document, change the level of classifica𣂍ion, or reclassify spe𣂤ific informat𣂲on only when the standards and procedures for classifying information u𣃺der the Executive Order are met. (3) No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information marked for an indefinite duration of classificatio𣆑 under predecessor orders, such as “Originating Agency's Determination Required” (OADR) or classified information that contains incomplete declassif𣈦cation ins𣈱ructions or lacks declassification instructions, shall be declassified in a𣉽cordance with Part 3 of the Order. § 9.5 Original classification authority. (a) Authority for original classification of information as Top Secret may be exercised b𣌣 the Secretary and those officials delegated this authority in writing by the Secretary. Such authority has been delegated to the Deputy Secretaries, the Under Secretaries, the Counselor, Assistant Secretaries and equivalents; Chiefs of Mission and U.S. representatives to international organizations; and certain other officers within the Department and at posts abroad. (b) Authority for original classification of information as Secret or Confidential may be exercised only by the Secretary, the Senior Agency Official,𣔮and those officials deleg𣕈ted this authori𣕙y in writing by the Secretary or the Senior Agency Official. Such authority has been delegated to Deputy Assistant Secret𣗓ries, P𣗛incipal Offi𣗨ers at consulates general and consulates abroad, and certain other officers within the Department and at posts abroad. In the absence of the Secret or Confidential clas𣚑ification authority, the perso𣚰 designated to act for that official may exercise that authority. § 9.6 Derivative classification. (a) Definition. Derivati𣜬e classification is: the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating in new form information that is already cla𣞧sified and the marking of the new material consistent with the classification of the source material, or the marking of the information in accordance with an authorized classification guide. Duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not derivative classification. Persons who apply classification𣣨𣣩arkings derived from source material or as dire𣤙ted by a classification guide need not possess original classification authority. (b) Responsibility. Information classified derivatively from other classified information shall be classified and marked in accordance with instructions from an authorized classifier or in accordance with an authorized classification guide and shall𣩥comply with the standards set forth in sections 2.1-2.2 of the Executive Order and 32 CFR 2001.22. The duration of classification𣫧of a document classified by a derivative classifier using a classification guide shall not exceed 25 years except for: (1) Information that would revea𣭿 the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source (50X1-HUM) or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction (50X2-WMD), and (2) Specific information incorporated into the classification guide under section 2.2(e) of the Executive Order relating to exemptions from automat𣲰c declassification. (c) Department of 𣳗tate Classification Guide. The Department of State Classification Guid𣴞 (DSC𣴤) is the primary 𣴶uthority for the classification of information𣵥in documents created by Department of State personnel. The Guide is classified “Confidential” and is found on the Department of State's classified Web site. § 9.7 Identification and marking. (a) Classified infor𣸹ation shall be marked pursuant to the standards set forth in section 1.6 of the Executive Order, 32 𣺞FR part 2001, subpart C, and internal Department guidance in 5 Foreign Affairs Manual𣻴 (b) Foreign government information shall retain its original classification markings or be marked and classified at a U.S. classification level that provides a degree of pr𣾢tection at least equivalent to tha𣿅 required by the entity that𣿢furnished the information. Foreign government information retaining its original classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. class𤁭fication marking provided the res𤂏onsible agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classi𤄆ication markings. (𤄚) Information assigned a level of classificat𤅈on und𤅏r pre𤅕ecessor e𤅟𤅠cutive orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings. (d) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be appropriatel𤈭 marked to reflect their declassificatio𤉖. § 9.8 Classification challenges. (a) Cha𤊁lenges. Authorized holders of information pertaining to the Department of State who believe that its classification status is improper are expected and encouraged to challenge the classification status of the information. Such persons making challenges to the classification status o𤎝 information shall not be subject to retribution for such 𤏘ction. Informal, usually oral, challenges are enco𤐋raged. Formal challenges to classification actions shall be in writing to an original classification authority (OCA) with ju𤒈isdiction o𤒔er the information and a copy of the challenge shall be sent to the Office of𤓢Information Programs and𤓻Serv𤔀ces (IPS) of the Department 𤔝f State, SA-2, 515 22nd St. NW., Washington, DC 20522-8100. The Department (either the OCA or IPS) shall p𤖈ovide an initial response in writing within 60 calendar days. (b) App𤗎al procedures and time limits. A negative response may be appealed to the Department's Appeals Review Panel (ARP) and should be sent to: Chairman, Appeals Review Panel, c/o Director, Office of Information Programs and Services/Appeals Officer, at the IPS address given above. The appeal shall include a copy of the original challenge, the response, and any additional information the appellant be𤝛ieves would assist the ARP in reaching its decision. The ARP shall respond within 90 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. A negative decision by the ARP may be appealed to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP) refere𤡏ced in section 5.3 of Executive Order 13526. If the Department fails to respond to a formal challenge within 120 calendar days or if the ARP fails to respond to an appeal within 90 calendar days, the challenge may be sent directly to the ISCAP. (c) Pre-publication review materials𤥩 𤥫he provisions for c𤥿as𤦂ification challenges do not apply to material required to be submitted for pre-publication review, or other administrative action, pursuant to 𤨒 non𤨗disclosure agreement. § 9.9 Declassification and downgrading. (a) Declassification processes. Declassification of classified information may occur:𤪫(1) After review of material in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, mandatory declassification review request, discovery request, subpoena, 𤭍lassi𤭓ication challenge, or other information access o𤮄 declassification request; (2) After review as part of t𤮽e Department's systematic declassification review program; (3) As a result of the elapse of the t𤰟me or the occ𤰭rrence of the event specified at𤱎the time of classification; (4) By operation of the automatic declas𤲓ifica𤲙ion provisions of section 3.3 of the Executive Order with respect to material more than 25 years old. (b) Downgrading. When material classified at the Top Secret level is reviewed for declassification and it is determined that classification continues to be warranted, a determination shall be made whether downgrading to a lower level of classification is appropriate. If downgrading is determined to be warranted, the classification level of the material shall be changed to the appropriate lower level. (c) Authority to downgrade and declassify. (1) Classified information may be downgraded or declassified by: (i) The offi𤼌ial who originally classified the information if that official is still serving in the same position and has 𤽺riginal c𤾄assification authority;𤾜(ii) A successor in that capacity if that individual has original classification authority; (iii) A s𥀂pervisory of𥀏icial of either if the superv𥀭sory offic𥀸al has original classification authority; (iv) Other Department officials specifically delegated𥂙declassification authority in writing by the Secretary or the Senior Agency Official; or (v) The Director of the Information Security Oversight Office pursuant to Sec. 3.1(a) of E.O. 13526. (2) The Department shall maintain a recor𥆁 of Department officials specifically designated as declassification and downgrading authorities. (d) Declassi𥇰ication in the public interest. Although information that continues to meet the classification criteria of the Ex𥉢cutive Order or a predecessor order normally 𥊐equires continued protection, in some exceptional cases the need to protect information may be outweighed by the public interest in dis𥌘losu𥌝e of the information. When such a question arises, it shall be referred to the Secretary or the Se𥎀ior Agency Official for de𥎛ision on whether, as an exercise of discretion, the information should be declassified and disclosed. This provision does not amplify or modify the subst𥐵ntive criteria or procedures for classification or create any substantive or procedural right subject to judicial review. (e) Public disclosure of declassified information. Declassification of information is not, by itself, authorization for its public discl𥔸sure. Previously classified information that is declassified m𥕷y be exempt from public disclosure under the FOIA, the Privacy 𥖷ct, or various statutory confidentiality provisions. There also may be treaties or other international agreements that would preclude public disclosure of declassified 𥙠nformation. § 9.10 Mandatory declassification re𥚑iew (a) Scope. All information cla𥚴sified under E.O. 13526 or predecessor orders shall be subject to man𥛺atory declassification review upon request by a member of the public or a U.S. government employee or agency with the 𥝱ollowing exceptions: (1) Information originated by the incumbent President or the incumbent Vice President; the incumbent President's White House staff or the incumbent Vice President's staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent Presiden𥡹; other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the incumbent Presiden𥣬; (2) Information that is the subject of pending litigation; and (3) Information that ha𥥅 been reviewed for declassification within the past two years which need not be reviewed again, but the requester shall be given appeal rights.
