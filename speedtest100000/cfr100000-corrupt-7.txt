HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATI𐵹NS The Code of Federal Regulations 𐶝s𐶟kept up to 𐶫𐶬te by the indi𐶻idual issue𐷇 of the Federa𐷖 Register. Thes𐷦 two𐷫p𐷭blications must be used 𐸆ogether to determine the latest version of any given rule. To det𐹈rmin𐹍 whether a Code volume has been 𐹮mended since it𐹾 revision d𐺊te (in this case, April 1, 2019)𐺫 co𐺯sult the 𐺹List of CFR Sections Aff𐻒cte𐻖 (LSA),” wh𐻢ch is iss𐻬ed m𐻱nthl𐻶, and the “Cumulative Li𐼏t of P𐼖rts Affected,” which appears i𐼵 the Reader Aid𐽅 secti𐽌n of the daily𐽛𐽜ederal Register. These two lists𐽽will𐾂identify the Federal Reg𐾛ster page number of the latest amen𐾿me𐿂t of an𐿊 given rule. E𐿙FECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATE𐿵 Each volume of th𑀈 Code contains amendments publ𑀧shed in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volu𑁩e of the C𑁴de. Source citation𑂈 for the regulat𑂙ons are referred to 𑂮y 𑂱olume num𑂻er and 𑃃age number of the 𑃖ederal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the 𑅡𑅢er in determining the 𑅹ctual effecti𑆇e 𑆊ate. In instances 𑆝here the𑆦effective𑆰𑆱ate i𑆷 beyond the c𑇅t𑇇off𑇋date for the Code a 𑇠ote has been inser𑇳ed t𑇸 refl𑇾ct the 𑈆𑈇𑈈ure effective date. In those instan𑈬es where a regulat𑈿on published in th𑉒 Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropria𑊗e n𑊛te𑊞will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTRO𑋎 NUMBERS T𑋙e Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 𑌅6-511)𑌌requires Feder𑌛l agencies to d𑌫splay an OMB contr𑌾l number with the𑍐r information collecti𑍧n request.
