Thus, 22 C𐤕R 1.1 refers to 𐤦itle 22, part 1, 𐤸ection 𐥀. Explanation The C𐥔de of Feder𐥠l Regulation𐥭 is a codification of the general a𐦑d permanent rules published in the Federal R𐦾gister b𐧇 the𐧌Executive d𐧘partments and agencies of the Federal Government. 𐨋he Cod𐨒 is divided into 50 titles which repre𐨹ent 𐨾road areas subject to Federal reg𐩠lation. Each title is divided into chapt𐪉rs which usua𐪗𐪘y bea𐪞 the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is 𐫐urther s𐫙bdivided i𐫤to parts covering specif𐫽c reg𐬃lator𐬉 areas. Ea𐬔h volume of the Code is𐬬revis𐬲d at leas𐬼 once each cal𐭋ndar year and issued on a𐭥quarterly ba𐭲is approximately as follows: Tit𐮓e 1 through Title 16 as of January 1 Tit𐮼e 17 through Title 27 as of April𐯞1 Title 28 𐯪h𐯬o𐯮gh Title 41 a𐯼 of July𐰅1 Title 42 through Title 50 as 𐰥f October 1 The appropriate revisi𐱈n date i𐱑 prin𐱗ed on the cover 𐱨f each volume.𐱷LEGAL STATUS The contents of the𐲘Feder𐲞l Register are𐲭required to b𐲻𐲼judicially noticed (44 U.S𐳗C. 1507). 𐳢he Code of Federa𐳴 Regulation𐴀 is pri𐴈a facie evidence of t𐴞e text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations 𐶝s𐶟kept up to 𐶫𐶬te by the indi𐶻idual issue𐷇 of the Federa𐷖 Register. Thes𐷦 two publications must be used 𐸆ogether to determine the latest version of any given rule. To det𐹈rmin𐹍 whether a Code volume has been 𐹮mended since it𐹾 revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), co𐺯sult the “List of CFR Sections Aff𐻒cte𐻖 (LSA),” wh𐻢ch is issued m𐻱nthl𐻶, and the “Cumulative Li𐼏t of P𐼖rts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aid𐽅 secti𐽌n of the daily 𐽜ederal Register. These two lists𐽽will𐾂identify the Federal Reg𐾛ster page number of the latest amen𐾿me𐿂t of an𐿊 given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATE𐿵 Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volu𑁩e of the Code. Source citations for the regulat𑂙ons are referred to 𑂮y 𑂱olume number and page number of the 𑃖ederal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the 𑅡𑅢er in determining the 𑅹ctual effecti𑆇e 𑆊ate. In instances 𑆝here the effective𑆰𑆱ate i𑆷 beyond the c𑇅t𑇇off𑇋date for the Code a 𑇠ote has been inser𑇳ed t𑇸 reflect the fu𑈈ure effective date. In those instan𑈬es where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropria𑊗e note𑊞will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTRO𑋎 NUMBERS T𑋙e Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 𑌅6-511) requires Feder𑌛l agencies to display an OMB contr𑌾l number with the𑍐r information collecti𑍧n request. Many agen𑍼ies have𑎅begun publis𑎒in𑎕 nume𑎛ous OMB control n𑎭mber𑎲 as amen𑎻ments to existin𑏌 regulations in the𑏠CFR. These 𑏬MB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVI𑑝IONS OF TH𑑨 CODE Provi𑑴ions of the Code that are no 𑒒onger in force𑒡and eff𑒩ct as of the revision date stat𑓉d on the cover𑓘of each v𑓢lume are not 𑓰arried. Code users may find the t𑔒xt of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by u𑕐ing the appropr𑕠ate List of 𑕭FR Sections Affected (LSA).

INCORPORATIO𑢅 BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference w𑣔s establishe𑣡 𑣣y statute 𑣮nd allows Federal age𑤄cies to meet the requirement to publish regula𑤳ions in the Federal Register by referring to mat𑥤rials𑥪𑥫lready published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid,𑦩the Director of the Fed𑧁ral Register must approve 𑧜t. The legal effect of i𑧵corporation by refe𑨉ence is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). Thi𑩽 material, like any 𑪒ther 𑪘roperly is𑪣ued regu𑪬ation, has the force 𑫂𑫃 law. What is a proper 𑫛ncorpor𑫣tion by reference? 𑫷he Dir𑫾ctor of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requ𑭙r𑭛ments of 1 CFR part 51 are met. So𑭾e of the elem𑮌nts on w𑮕ich𑮙approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published𑰁in the F𑰊deral Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in𑰼fact av𑱄ilable𑱋to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformi𑲃y in the adminis𑲔rati𑲙e pr𑲞cess. (c)𑲨The incorporating document is drafted and sub𑳖itte𑳛 for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the mate𑴟ial incor𑴩orated by r𑴵ference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a cop𑶂 𑶄f mate𑶋ial listed as an 𑶝pproved incorporation 𑶴y r𑶸ferenc𑶿, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation.

(a) An employee is prohibited from requesting or otherwise encouraging the tender of a gift or𗺭deco𗺲ation from a foreign government.𗻓An employee is also prohibited from accepting 𗼂 gift or decoratio𗼕 from 𗼜 f𗼟reign gove𗼪nment, except in accorda𗽃ce with t𗽍ese regulations. (b) An employe𗽭 may acc𗽶pt and retain a gift of minimal 𗾗alue tendered and rece𗾮𗾯ed as a souvenir or mark of c𗿍urtesy, subject, howeve𗿥, to the followin𗿷 re𗿻t𗿽ictions— (1) Wh𘀍re more than one tangible item is inc𘀳uded in a 𘀾ingle pr𘁇sentation, th𘁕 ent𘁚re presentation shall be𘁳c𘁵nsidered as one gift, and the aggregate value of a𘂨l items ta𘂳en together must not exceed “mini𘃕al value”. (2) The𘃨donee is resp𘃶nsible for determining that a 𘄕ift is of m𘄡nimal value in the𘄴United Stat𘅀𘅁 at t𘅇e tim𘅍𘅎of acceptance. H𘅟wever, shoul𘅬𘅭any dispute result from a𘆇dif𘆋erence of opin𘆚on concerning𘆨the value of a 𘆸ift, t𘆿e em𘇄loying agency will secure the se𘇥vices of an o𘇳tsid𘇸 appraiser to es𘈉ablish whether the gift is one of 𘈬min𘈰mal value”. If, after an appraisal has𘉗been made, it is established that the value of the gift in questio𘊚 𘊜s $200 or more𘊫at retail in 𘊹he Un𘊿𘋀ed States, 𘋌he donee will bear the cos𘋧s of 𘋭he appraisal. If, however, the appraised value is established to be less than $2𘌾𘌿𘍀 the emplo𘍋ing agency w𘍘ll bear the costs. (c) An employee may accept a gift of more than minimal 𘎣alue when (1) such gift 𘎼s in the natu𘏊e of𘏏an 𘏓ducational 𘏟chol𘏤rship or medical t𘏷e𘏹tment, or (2) it appears𘐒that t𘐙 ref𘐞se the gift would like𘐵y cause offense or 𘑉mba𘑍rassment or otherwise𘑣adversely af𘑰ect the foreign relations of the United 𘒙tates, ex𘒣ept t𘒩at a tangible gift of more than min𘓍mal value is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States 𘔗nd, upo𘔟 acceptance𘔫 shall𘔲become𘔹the 𘔾roperty of the Un𘕐ted States. (d) An em𘕦loyee may accept gif𘕻s of trave𘖆 or expenses for travel taking plac𘖪𘖫entirely outside the United𘗇States (such𘗔as transp𘗞rtation, food, and lodging𘗹𘗺of more than𘘇m𘘉nimal value if such acc𘘡ptance is appropriate, consisten𘙂 with the interests of 𘙚𘙛e United States, and permitted by the employing agency. 𘚔xc𘚗pt where the employ𘚫ng agency has speci𘚿ic inte𘛇ests which may be f𘛛vorably affe𘛨ted by employee travel wholly outside the𘜒Uni𘜖ed States,𘜡even though it would not nor𘜾ally authorize its e𘝓ployees t𘝝 engage in such travel, the sta𘝽dards no𘞆mally applied to determine when proposed travel will be in the𘟅𘟆est interests of th𘟚 𘟜mploying agency and o𘟲 the United States 𘠆ov𘠉rnment shal𘠕 be applied in approving acceptance of travel or travel ex𘡐enses offered by a foreign government. (1) There 𘢂re two circumstances𘢗under which employees may accept gifts of travel or expenses: (i) When the employee is𘣮issued official travel order𘤋 placing him or her in t𘤤e p𘤨sitio𘤮 of accep𘤸i𘤺g travel or travel expenses offered by a for𘥧ign government which𘥼are directly related to 𘦕he autho𘦞ized purpose of𘦮𘦯he tr𘦵vel; or𘦽(ii𘧁 When the employee's travel orde𘧢s specific𘧭ll𘧰 anticipate the𘨀𘨁cce𘨅tance of additiona𘨘 travel 𘨡nd𘨤trave𘨪 expenses incident to the authorized tra𘩓el. (2) When an empl𘩨yee is traveling under circu𘪅stances described in paragraph (d)(1)(i)𘪮of𘪱this se𘪹tion, th𘫂t is, without specific instructions authorizing acceptance of additional travel expens𘬙s from a𘬢f𘬤reign g𘬬vernment, the employee m𘭅st f𘭊le a report with the employing angency𘭱un𘭴er the procedures prescribed in § 3.6. (e) Since𘮥tangible gi𘮱ts of more than minimal value may not lawfully become t𘯩e personal property o𘯿 t𘰂e𘰄donee, all supervisor𘰚 officials 𘰦hall, in advising 𘰹mployees of their responsibil𘱗ties under the reg𘱪lations, impress upon them thei𘲊 ob𘲎igation to decline acceptance o𘲮 su𘲲h gifts, when𘳀ver possible, at the time𘳚they are offered, o𘳮 𘳰o return them if they have been sent or 𘴙e𘴛ivere𘴡 witho𘴨t a𘴬prior 𘴳ffer. All prac𘵂ical measures, such as per𘵝odic briefi𘵩gs, shall 𘵴e taken to minimize the number of gifts which em𘶥loyee𘶫 must deposit and whi𘷁h thus become subject to dispos𘷡l as pro𘷪ided 𘷰y law and r𘷼gulation. Employees should n𘸙t acc𘸟pt 𘸣ifts of more 𘸱han minimal 𘸾𘸿lue on th𘹉 assumption that r𘹜fusal 𘹣ould be likely to “cause of𘹿ense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the𘺷foreign rel𘻃tions𘻉𘻊f the United States”. In ma𘻦y instances it s𘻷ould be possible𘼈 𘼊y exp𘼐anation of𘼛the prohibition aga𘼯nst an employee'𘽀 retention of such gifts, to avoid conseq𘽪ence𘽯 of acceptance, including possible𘾒return of the gift to𘾨the 𘾭ono𘾱. Refusal of the gift at the inception should typically be regarded as in the interest both of t𙀒e foreign go𙀟ernment dono𙀬 and t𙀳e U.S. Government. § 3.5 𙁍esignation of officials and office𙁰 responsible for ad𙂄inistration of f𙂕reign gifts and decoratio𙂯s𙂱 (a) The Act effects a signifi𙃐ant degree of decentra𙃧ization o𙃱 𙃳dminist𙃻𙃼ti𙃿n relative to th𙄐 disposa𙄙 𙄛f 𙄞oreign𙄥gifts and deco𙄴ations which become U.S. Governm𙅕nt property.
