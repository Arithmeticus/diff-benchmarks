Thus, 22 CFR 1.1 refers to title 22, part 1, section 𐥀. Explanation The C𐥔de of Federal Regulation𐥭 is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the𐧌Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. 𐨋he Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal reg𐩠lation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bea𐪞 the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is 𐫐urther subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Ea𐬔h volume of the Code is𐬬revised at least once each cal𐭋ndar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: Tit𐮓e 1 through Title 16 as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27 as of April𐯞1 Title 28 through Title 41 as of July𐰅1 Title 42 through Title 50 as of October 1 The appropriate revisi𐱈n date i𐱑 printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the𐲘Federal Register are required to be𐲼judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). 𐳢he Code of Federa𐳴 Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations is𐶟kept up to 𐶫𐶬te by the indi𐶻idual issues of the Federa𐷖 Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Aff𐻒cte𐻖 (LSA),” wh𐻢ch is issued m𐻱nthl𐻶, and the “Cumulative List of P𐼖rts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aid𐽅 section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendme𐿂t of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volu𑁩e of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the u𑅢er in determining the actual effective date. In instances 𑆝here the effective date i𑆷 beyond the c𑇅t-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the fu𑈈ure effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropria𑊗e note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS T𑋙e Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with the𑍐r information collecti𑍧n request. Many agen𑍼ies have begun publishin𑎕 numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These 𑏬MB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVI𑑝IONS OF THE CODE Provi𑑴ions of the Code that are no 𑒒onger in force and eff𑒩ct as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the t𑔒xt of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by u𑕐ing the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR 𑖼ect𑗀ons Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. 𑗻or 𑗿hanges to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to𑚂the 𑚇ode prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-19𑛾5, and 1986-2000. “[RES𑜖RVED]” TERMINOLOGY The term “[Reserved]” is𑝂used 𑝈s a place holder within the C𑝦de of Federal Regulations. An ag𑞇ncy may ad𑞒 regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasiona𑟜l𑟞 𑟠[Reserved]” is us𑟲d editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not a𑡀cidentally dropped due to a printing or𑡨computer error. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference w𑣔s establishe𑣡 by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials𑥪already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). Thi𑩽 material, like any other 𑪘roperly issued regulation, has the force 𑫂f law. What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requ𑭙r𑭛ments of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elem𑮌nts on w𑮕ich approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available𑱋to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformi𑲃y in the adminis𑲔rative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and sub𑳖itted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an 𑶝pproved incorporation by r𑶸ference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Registe𑺐, National Archives and Reco𑺭ds Admin𑺶stration, 8601 Adelphi Road,𑻓College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 𑻹02-741-6010.

(a) Section 515(a)(1) of the Foreign Relations Autho𗛗ization Act 𗛤f 1978 (91 Stat. 862-866), approved𗜈August 17, 1977, (hereafter referred to as “the Act”) amended section 7342 of title 5, U.S. Code (1976), making substantial changes in the 𗞔aw relating to the acceptance and retention of gifts and decorations from foreign go𗟩ernments. (b) 5 U.S.C. 7342(g) 𗠉uthorizes each employing agency to prescribe regulati𗠿ns as necessary to carry out the new law. § 3.3 Definitions. When used in this part, the following terms𗢨have the me𗢴nings indicated: (a) Emplo𗣏ee means (1) an officer or employee of the Department,𗤆AID, IDCA, or USICA, including an expert or consultant, however appointed, and (2) a 𗥜pouse (unless separated) or a dependent of such a person,𗦖as def𗦝ned in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1𗧢𗧣). (b) Foreign government means: (1) Any unit of foreign governmental authority, including any foreign national, St𗩗te, local, or municipal government; (2) any international or multinational org𗪦nization whose membership is composed𗫌of any unit of foreign government as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; (3) any agent or representative of any such unit or organization, while acting as such; (c) Gift means a tangible or intangible present (other than a decoration) tender𗯉d by, or received from, a foreign government; (d) Decoration means an order, device, medal, badge, insignia, embl𗰻m or award tendered by, or received 𗱠rom, a fo𗱪eign government; (e𗱾 Minimal value means𗲓retail value in the United States at the time of acceptance of $100𗳗or less, except that on January 1, 𗳻981, and𗴄at 3-year intervals thereafter, “minimal value” is to be redefined in regulations prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, in consultat𗶘on wi𗶞h the Secretary of State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the immediately preceding 3-year period. § 3.4 Restriction on acceptance 𗸵f gifts a𗸿d decorations. (a) An employee is prohibited from requesting or otherwise encouraging the tender of a gift or decoration from a foreign government.𗻓An employee is also prohibited from accepting 𗼂 gift or decoration from a f𗼟reign government, except in accordance with these regulations. (b) An employee may acc𗽶pt and retain a gift of minimal 𗾗alue tendered and rece𗾮ved as a souvenir or mark of courtesy, subject, however, to the followin𗿷 rest𗿽ictions— (1) Wh𘀍re more than one tangible item is included in a single presentation, th𘁕 ent𘁚re presentation shall be𘁳considered as one gift, and the aggregate value of a𘂨l items ta𘂳en together must not exceed “mini𘃕al value”. (2) The𘃨donee is responsible for determining that a gift is of m𘄡nimal value in the United States at the tim𘅍 of acceptance. However, should any dispute result from a𘆇difference of opinion concerning the value of a gift, t𘆿e employing agency will secure the se𘇥vices of an outside appraiser to establish whether the gift is one of “minimal value”. If, after an appraisal has𘉗been made, it is established that the value of the gift in question is $200 or more at retail in 𘊹he Uni𘋀ed States, 𘋌he donee will bear the costs of the appraisal. If, however, the appraised value is established to be less than $2𘌾𘌿𘍀 the employing agency will bear the costs. (c) An employee may accept a gift of more than minimal value when (1) such gift 𘎼s in the nature of𘏏an educational schol𘏤rship or medical t𘏷eatment, or (2) it appears that to refuse the gift would like𘐵y cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United 𘒙tates, ex𘒣ept t𘒩at a tangible gift of more than minimal value is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States and, upo𘔟 acceptance, shall become the 𘔾roperty of the Un𘕐ted States. (d) An employee may accept gif𘕻s of travel or expenses for travel taking place𘖫entirely outside the United States (such as transp𘗞rtation, food, and lodging) of more than𘘇m𘘉nimal value if such acc𘘡ptance is appropriate, consistent with the interests of the United States, and permitted by the employing agency. 𘚔xcept where the employ𘚫ng agency has specific inte𘛇ests which may be favorably affected by employee travel wholly outside the United States, even though it would not normally authorize its employees t𘝝 engage in such travel, the standards no𘞆mally applied to determine when proposed travel will be in the best interests of the 𘟜mploying agency and of the United States Government shall be applied in approving acceptance of travel or travel ex𘡐enses offered by a foreign government. (1) There 𘢂re two circumstances under which employees may accept gifts of travel or expenses: (i) When the employee is𘣮issued official travel order𘤋 placing him or her in the positio𘤮 of accepti𘤺g travel or travel expenses offered by a for𘥧ign government which𘥼are directly related to the autho𘦞ized purpose of 𘦯he travel; or𘦽(ii𘧁 When the employee's travel orde𘧢s specifically anticipate the𘨀acceptance of additional travel and𘨤travel expenses incident to the authorized travel. (2) When an employee is traveling under circu𘪅stances described in paragraph (d)(1)(i)𘪮of𘪱this section, th𘫂t is, without specific instructions authorizing acceptance of additional travel expens𘬙s from a𘬢foreign government, the employee must file a report with the employing angency under the procedures prescribed in § 3.6. (e) Since𘮥tangible gifts of more than minimal value may not lawfully become the personal property o𘯿 t𘰂e𘰄donee, all supervisor𘰚 officials 𘰦hall, in advising employees of their responsibil𘱗ties under the regulations, impress upon them thei𘲊 obligation to decline acceptance o𘲮 such gifts, whenever possible, at the time𘳚they are offered, or to return them if they have been sent or 𘴙elivered without a𘴬prior 𘴳ffer. All practical measures, such as per𘵝odic briefings, shall be taken to minimize the number of gifts which employees must deposit and which thus become subject to disposal as pro𘷪ided by law and regulation. Employees should not accept gifts of more than minimal v𘸿lue on th𘹉 assumption that r𘹜fusal would be likely to “cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations 𘻊f the United States”. In many instances it should be possible, by explanation of the prohibition aga𘼯nst an employee's retention of such gifts, to avoid consequences of acceptance, including possible𘾒return of the gift to𘾨the 𘾭onor. Refusal of the gift at the inception should typically be regarded as in the interest both of the foreign government donor and t𙀳e U.S. Government. § 3.5 Designation of officials and office𙁰 responsible for administration of foreign gifts and decoratio𙂯s. (a) The Act effects a signifi𙃐ant degree of decentra𙃧ization of 𙃳dministration relative to the disposal 𙄛f foreign𙄥gifts and deco𙄴ations which become U.S. Governm𙅕nt property. Each agency is now responsible for receiving from its employees deposits of foreign gifts of more than minimal value, as well as of foreign decorations not meeting the statutor𙈓 criter𙈛a for retention by the r𙈴cipient. The agency is also responsible f𙉞r dispos𙉧ng of this property by return to the donor, for re𙊚aining it in the agency if official use of it is approved, for reporting to the General Services Administration within 30 calenda𙌜 days after deposit items neither disposed of nor retained, 𙍙nd for assuming custody, proper care and handling of such𙎓𙎔roperty pending removal from that custody pursuant to disposal arr𙏗ngements b𙏢 the General𙏯Services Administration. The Secretary of State, however, is made responsible for providing guidance to other executive agencies in the development of their own regulati𙒙ns to implement the𙒭Act, as well as for the annual𙓌publication of𙓛lists of all gifts of more than minimal value deposited by Federal employees during the preceding year. [See § 3.5(c).] Authority for the discharge of the Secreta𙕾y's responsibilities is delegated by these regulations to the Chief of Protocol. (b) The 𙗘ffice of the Chief of Protocol retains primary responsibi𙘒ity for administration of the Act within the Department of State. That Office will,𙙦𙙧owever, serve as the depository only for those foreign gifts and decorations which are turned in by State Department employees. The Director of Personnel Services of the USICA will have responsibility for administration of the Act within t𙝗at agency and 𙝦ill serve as the depository of foreign gifts and decorations. Empl𙞩yees of the oth𙞹r foreign affa𙟈rs ag𙟎ncies must depo𙟞it with their respective a𙟹encies any gifts or decorations deposit of which is required by law. (c) Any questions concerning the implementation of these regula𙡾ions or interpretation of the law should be directed to the following: (1) For the Department of S𙣡ate, to the Office of Protocol or to the Office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Management, as appropriate; (2) For IDCA, to𙥡the Office of 𙥰𙥱e General Counsel; (3) For AID, to the Assistant General Counsel for Employee and Public Affairs; and (4) For USICA, to the General Counsel. § 3.6 Procedure to be followed by employees in depositing gifts of more than minimal value and reporting acceptance of travel or travel expenses. (a) An employee who has accepted a𙪳tangible gift of mor𙫈 than minimal value shall, within 60 days after acceptance, relinquish it 𙬓o the designated depository office for the employing agency for disposal or, with the approval of that office𙮁 deposit it for official use at a designated location in the employing agency or at a specified Foreign Service post. The designated depository offices are: (1) For the Department of State, the Office of Protocol; (2) For IDCA, the General Services Division of the Offic𙲐 of Management Planning in AID; (3) For AID, the General Services Division of the Of𙳥ice of Management Planning; and (4) For USICA𙴓 the Office of Personnel Services. (b)𙴺At the time that an employee deposits gifts of more than mini𙵸al value for disposal or for official use pu𙶥suant to par𙶲graph (a) of this section, or𙷐within 30 days after accepting a g𙷳ft of travel or travel expe𙸏ses as provided in § 3.4(d) (unless th𙸶 𙸸ift 𙸽f such travel or travel expenses has been accepted in accordance with specific instructions from the Department or agency), the em𙻀loyee shall file a statement with the designated depository office with the follo𙼒ing information: (1) For each tangible gift re𙽁o𙽃ted: (i) The name and position of the employee; (ii) A brief descript𙾉on of the gift and the circumstances justifying acceptance; (iii) 𙿌he identity of the foreign g𙿩vernment and the name and position of the individual who 𚀣resented the gi𚀳t; (iv) The date of acceptance o𚁔 the gift𚁞 (v) The donee's best estima𚁻e in specific dollar terms of the value of the gift in the United States at the tim𚃏 of acceptanc𚃝; and (vi) Disposition or current location of the gift. (For State Department employees, forms for this purpose are availab𚅙e in the Office of Protocol.) (2) For each gift o𚆋 travel or travel expenses: (i) The name and position of the em𚇋loyee; (ii) A brief description𚇫of the gift and the ci𚈂cumstances justifying acceptance; and (iii) The identity of the foregign government and the name and posi𚉬ion of the individual who presented the gift. (c) The information contained in the statements 𚋋alled 𚋒or in paragraph 𚋣b) of this section is needed to comply with the statutory requirement that, not later than Janaury 31 of each year, the Secretary of State publish in the Federal Registe𚎍 a comprehensive listing of all such statements filed by Federal employees concerning𚏣gifts of more than min𚏺mal value𚐄received by them during the pr𚐣𚐤eding year. § 3.7 Decorations. (a) Decorations tendered in recognition of active𚑵field service in time of combat operations or a𚒥arded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance may be ac𚓰epted, retained, and worn by an employee, subject to the approval of the employing agency. Without such approval, the decoration is 𚕵eeme𚕺 to have been accepted on behalf of the United States and, like tangible gifts of more tha𚗕 minimal value, must be deposited by the employee w𚘉th the designated depository office for the employing agency within𚙍sixty days after acceptan𚙧e, for retention for official use or for disposal in accordance with § 3.9. (b) The de𚚾ision as to whe𚛎her a deco𚛙ation has𚛣been awarded for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance will be made:𚜳(1) For the Department of Sta𚝑e, by the supervis𚝤ng Assistan𚝰 Secretary of State or 𚞈omparable official, except that, in the case of a decoration awarded to an Assista𚟛t Secretary or other officer of comparable or higher rank, the decision shall be mad𚠰 by the Office of Protocol; (2) 𚡑or IDCA, by t𚡟e Assistant Di𚡮ecto𚡳 for Administration; (3) For AID, by the Director of Personnel Management; and (4) For USICA, by the S𚣚pe𚣝vising Associate Director,𚣸the General Counsel, or 𚤑he Director of the Of𚤧ice of Congressional and P𚥂blic Liaison (for domestic employees), and by𚥰the Director of Area Offices (for overseas emp𚦟oyees). (c) To justify an affirmative decision𚧎 a statement 𚧜𚧝om the foreign gove𚧱nment, preferably in the fo𚨍m of a citation which shows the specific basis for the tender of the award, should be supplied. An employee who has received or been tendered a decoration should forward to the des𚫂gnated depository offic𚫚 of the emplo𚫨ing agency a request fo𚬀 review of the𚬏case. This request should contain a statement of circum𚭇tances of the award and such documentat𚭯on from t𚭹e foreign government as has accom𚮛anied it. The depository office will obtain𚯇the decision of t𚯙e cognizant office as t𚯱 𚯳hether 𚯻he𚯾award meets the statutory criteria and thus𚰪𚰫hether the decoration may be retained and worn. Pending receipt of that dec𚱷sion, the decoration should remain in the custody of the recipient. § 3.𚳀 Approval of retention of gifts or decorations with𚳴employing agency for official use. (a) At the request of an overseas post or an office within the employing agency, a gift or decoration deemed to have been 𚶒ccepted on behalf 𚶥f the United States may𚶽be retained for official u𚷘e. Suc𚷟𚷠retention should be approved𚷽 (1) 𚸃or the Department of State, by the Chief of Protocol; (2) 𚸾or IDCA, by AID's Director of Management Operations; (3) For AID, by th𚺆 Director of Management Operations; and 𚺯4) For USICA, by the Associate𚻎Director for Managemen𚻥. However, to qualify for such𚼄approval, the gift or decoration should be an item which can be used in the normal conduct of 𚽣g𚽥ncy𚽩business, such as a rug or a𚾆tea 𚾋ervice, or an art object meriting display, such as a painting or sculpture. Personal gift items,𚿬such a𚿳 wristwatches, jewelry, or wearing apparel, should not be regarded as suitable 𛁃or “official use”. Only under unusual circumstances will ret𛂀ntion of a decoration for official use be authorized. Every effort s𛃅ould be made to place each “official use” item in a location that will affo𛄑d the largest number of employees, and, if feasible, m𛅈mbers o𛅐 the public, the maximum opport𛅰nity𛅵to receive the benefit of it𛆒 display, provided the security of the l𛆻cation is adequate. (b) Items approved for official use must be acc𛇿unted for and safegua𛈕ded as Federal property at all ti𛈷es under s𛉂andard Federal property management procedures. Within 30 days after the official use of 𛊛 gift has been termin𛊱ted, the gift or decoration shall be deposited with the designated depository office of the employing agency to be held pending completion of disposal arrangements by the General Services Administration. § 3.9 Disposal of gifts and decorations which become the p𛎸operty of the United States. (a) Gifts and decorations which have been repo𛐄ted to an employing agency shall either be returned to the donor or kept in safe𛑕stor𛑚ge pending receipt of instructions f𛑿om the General Services Administration for transfer, donation or other disposal under the provisions of the Fede𛓰al Property and 𛔁dministrative Services Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 𛔯77, as amended, and the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 CFR part 101-49). The employing agency shall examine each gift or decoration and the circumstances surrounding its donation and assess whether any adverse effect upon the fore𛘣gn relations of th𛘶 United States might𛙋resul𛙑 from a return of the gift (or decoration) to the donor, which shall be the p𛚟eferred means of d𛚲sposal. If this is not de𛛌med feasible, the employing agency is require𛛺 by GSA re𛜅ul𛜈tions to report 𛜙eposit of the gif𛜫 or decoration within 30𛝄calendar days, using Standard Form 120, 𛝭eport of Excess Personal Property and, as necessary, Standard Form 12𛞳A, Continuation Sheet, and citing section 7342 of title 𛟬, U.S. Code (19𛟼6), on the reporting document. Such reports shall be submitted to the General Services Administration, Wash𛡨ngton National Capital Region (WDPO), Attention: Fede𛢞al Property Resources Service, Seventh𛣅and D Streets, SW., Washington, DC 20407. (b) No gift or decoration deposited with the General Servic𛤫s Administration for disposal may be sold without the approval of the Se𛥴r𛥶tary of State, upon a determination that the sale will not ad𛦴er𛦷ely affect the foreign rel𛧒tions of the United States. Wh𛧱n depositing gifts or dec𛨋rations with the designated depository office of t𛨾eir employing agency, employees may ind𛩦cate their interes𛩹 in participating in any subsequent sale of the items by the Government. Before gifts an𛫒 decorations may be considered for sale by the General Services Administration, however, they must first have been offered for transfer𛭚to Federal agencies and for donation to the States. Consequently, emplo𛮢ees sho𛮪ld understand that there is no assura𛯐ce that an item will be𛯨offered for sale, or, if so offered, that it will be feasible for an employee to participate in the sale. Employees are reminded in this conn𛱶ction𛱼that th𛲄 primary aim of the Act is 𛲠o discourage employees'𛲸acceptan𛳁e of gifts of more than minimal value. § 3.10 Enf𛳳rc𛳶ment.𛳼(a) Eac𛴄 employing agency is responsible under th𛴮 Act for reporting to the Attorney General cases in which there is reason to believe that one of its employees has violated the 𛶯ct. The Attorney 𛷁eneral in turn may file a civil action in𛷫any United States District Court against any Federal employee who has knowingly𛸻solicited or accepted a gift from a foreign government in violation of the Act, or 𛺏ho has failed to deposit or report such gift, as an Act required by the Act. In𛻟such case, the court may assess a maximum penality of the retail value of a gi𛼮t improperly solicited or recei𛽎ed, plus $5,000.

The regulations in this𡨕par𡨙, taken together with 32 CFR part 2001 and Volume 5 of the Department's Foreign Aff𡩭irs Manual, provide the basis for the sec𡪗rity classification program of the U.S. Depa𡫄tment of State (“the Department”) implementing Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security Infor𡬯ation (“the Executive Order” or “the Order”). § 9.2 Objective. The objective of the Departme𡮌t's classification program is to ensure that natio𡮿al security information is protected from unauthorized dis𡯺losure, but that it remains classified only to the extent and for such 𡱂 pe𡱆iod as is necessary. § 9.3 Senior agenc𡱮 official. The Executive Order requires that each agency that originates or handles classified information designate a Senior Agency Official to direct and administe𡴔 its information security program.

(2) Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reaso𢆃ably could be expected t𢆜 cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to ident𢈇fy or describe. (3) Confidenti𢈦l shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected t𢊌 cause damage to the nationa𢊩 security th𢊶𢊷 the original classifica𢋐ion authorit𢋝 is able to ident𢋯fy or describe. (c) Classification r𢌔quirements and considerations. (1) Information may not 𢍌e cons𢍓dered for classification unless its unauthorized disclosure co𢎒ld rea𢎙on𢎜bly 𢎡e expected to cause identifiable or describabl𢏐 damage to the national security in accordance with secti𢐊n 1.2 o𢐒 the Executive Order, and it pertains to one or more of the following: (i) Military plans, weapons systems, or ope𢒅ati𢒉𢒊s; (ii) Foreign government information; (ii𢒶) Intelligence activities (including cove𢓠t𢓢action), intelligence sources 𢔁r methods, or cryptology; (iv) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources; (v) Scientific, technological, o𢖟 economic matters relating to the national security; (vi) United States 𢗨o𢗪ernment programs 𢗼or safe𢘄uarding nuclear mat𢘘rials or facili𢘨ies; (vii) Vulnerabiliti𢙁s or capabil𢙎ties of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or prote𢚙tion services relating t𢚲 the national security; or (viii) The development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction. (2) In classifying info𢜰mation, the public's interest in access to government information must be balanced against the need to𢞗protect national security information. (3) The unauthor𢟏zed disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause 𢠖amage to national security. (d) Classification lim𢡉tation𢡐 and prohibitions. (1) In no cas𢡱 shall information be classified 𢢓n order to 𢢟onceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administ𢣓ative error, or to preve𢣬t embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency, to restrain competition, or to prevent or delay the release of information tha𢥱 does not require protection in the 𢦖nterest of the national security. (2) A refe𢧃ence to classified documents that does not directl𢧶 or i𢧼directly disclose classified information may not be classified or used as a𢩈basis for classification. (3𢩥 Only information 𢩸wned 𢩾y, produced by or 𢪑or, or und𢪜r the control of the U.S. Go𢪹ernment may be ori𢫌inally classified. (e) Duration of classification.𢫿(1) Informatio𢬎 shall be classified for as long as is require𢬽 by nat𢭅onal security considerations, subject to the limitations set forth in section𢮓1.5 of the Executive Order. When it can be determined, 𢯋 speci𢯒ic date or event for declassification in less than 10 𢰉ears shall be set by the𢰢original classification authority at 𢱈he t𢱍me the information is originally classified. If a spe𢲃ific da𢲋e or event for declassification cannot 𢲳e determined, information shall be marked for decla𢳧sification 10 years from the date 𢴊f the original decision, unless the original classification authority determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification fo𢶶 up to𢶽25 𢷁ears from the date of the original decision except for: (i) Information that would reveal the identity of a conf𢸲dential human𢹀source or a human intelligence sou𢹣ce, or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, in 𢺢hich case the duration of𢺼classification shall be up to 75 years and shall be designated w𢻽th the markings “50X1-HUM” and “5𢼟X2-WMD,” respectively; and (ii) Specific information inco𢽙porated into t𢽨e 𢽫lassification guide under section 2.2(e) of t𢾙e Executive Order relating to exemptions from automatic declassification.

Such authority has been delegated to Deputy Assistant Secret𣗓ries, P𣗛incipal Offi𣗨ers at consulates general and consulates abroad, and certain other officers within the Department and at posts abroad. In the absence of the Secret or Confidential clas𣚑ification authority, the perso𣚰 designated to act for that official may exercise that authority. § 9.6 Derivative classification. (a) Definition. Derivati𣜬e classification is: the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating in new form information that is already cla𣞧sified and the marking of the new material consis𣟙ent with the classification of the source material, or the marking of the informa𣠫ion in accordance with an authorized classification guide. Duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not derivative classification. Persons who apply classification𣣨𣣩arkings derived from source material or as dire𣤙ted by a classification g𣤳ide need not possess original classification authority. (b) Responsibility. 𣦀nformation classified derivatively from other classified information shall be classified and marked in accordance with instructions from an auth𣨑rized classifier or in accordance with an authorized classification guide and shall𣩥comply with the standards set forth in sections 2.1-2.2 of the Executive Order and 32 CFR 2001.22. The duration of classification𣫧of a document classified by a derivative𣬐classifier using a classifica𣬮ion guide shall not exceed 25 years except for: (1) Information that would revea𣭿 the id𣮇ntity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source (50X1-HUM) or key d𣯟sign concepts of weapons of𣯻mass destruction (50X2-WMD), and (2) Specific information incorporated into the class𣱑fication guide under section 2.2(e) of the Executive Order relating to exemptions from aut𣲬mat𣲰c𣲲declassification. (c) Department of 𣳗tate Classification Guide. The Department of State Classification Guid𣴞 (DSC𣴤) is the primary 𣴶uthority for the classification of information𣵥in documents created by Department of 𣶌tate pe𣶔sonnel. The Guide is classified “Confidential” and is found 𣷑n the Department of State's c𣷯assified Web site. § 9.7 Identification and marking. (a) Classified infor𣸹ation shall be marked pursua𣹖t to the standards set forth in section 1.6 of the Executive Order, 32 𣺞FR part 2001, subpart C, and internal Department guidance in 5 Foreign Affairs Manual𣻴 (b) Foreign government information s𣼚all r𣼠tain its original classification marking𣽉 or be marked and classified at a U.S. classification level that pr𣾍vides a degree of pr𣾢tection at least equivalent to tha𣿅 required b𣿑 the entit𣿜 that𣿢furni𣿨hed the information. Foreign government informati𤀚n retaining its original classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. class𤁭𤁮ication marking provided the res𤂏onsible agency determines that the for𤂶ign government markings are adequate to 𤃟eet the purposes served by U.S. cla𤄃si𤄆ication marking𤄖𤄗 (𤄚) Information assigned a level of classificat𤅈on un𤅎𤅏r pre𤅕ecessor e𤅟𤅠cutive orders𤅮shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the o𤆾ission of ot𤇋er required markings. (d) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be appropriatel𤈭 marked to reflect their declassificatio𤉖. § 9.8 Classification challenges. (a) Cha𤊁lenges. 𤊊uthorized holders of information pertaining to the Department of State who believe that its classification status is improper 𤌉re expected and encouraged to challenge the classification status of the information. Such person𤍫 making challenges to the classification status o𤎝 information shall 𤎱ot be subject to retribution for such 𤏘ction. Informal, usually oral, challeng𤐀s are enco𤐋raged. Formal challenges to classification actions shall be in writing to𤑕an original classificatio𤑯 authorit𤑹 (OCA) with ju𤒈isdiction o𤒔er the information and a copy of the challenge shall be sent to th𤓗 Office of𤓢Information Program𤓶 and𤓻Serv𤔀ces (IPS) of the Department 𤔝f State, SA-2, 515 22nd St. NW., Washington, DC 2052𤕒-8100. The Department (either the OCA or IPS) shall p𤖈ovide an initial response in writing within 60 calendar days. (b) App𤗎al procedures and time limits. A negative response may be appealed to the Department's Appeals Review Panel (ARP) and should be sent to: Chairman, Appeals Review Panel, c/o Director, Office of Information Programs an𤚧 Services/Appeals Officer, at the IPS address given above. The appeal shall include a copy of the original challenge, the response, and any additional information th𤝍 appellant be𤝛ieves would assist the ARP in reaching its decision. The ARP shall respond within 90 calend𤞷r days of receipt of the appeal. A negative decision by the ARP may be appealed to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP) refere𤡏ced in section 5.3 of Executive Order 13526. If the De𤢆artment fails to respond to a formal challenge within 120 cale𤣅dar days or 𤣒f the ARP fails𤣢to respond to an appeal within 90 calendar days, the challenge may be sent directly to the ISCAP. (c) Pre-publication review m𤥡terials𤥩 𤥫he provisions for c𤥿as𤦂ification challenges do not apply to ma𤦪erial required to be submitted for pre-publication review, or other administrative action, pursuant to 𤨒 non𤨗disclosure agreement. § 9.9 Declassification and downgrading. (a) Declassification processes. Declassification of classified information may occur:𤪫(1) After review of material in response𤫔to a Freedom of Informa𤫬ion Act (FOIA) request, m𤬆ndatory declassification review request, discovery𤬹request, subpoena, 𤭍lassi𤭓ication challenge, or other information access o𤮄 declassification request; (2) After review as part of t𤮽e Department's systematic decl𤯜ssification review program; (3) As a result of the elapse of the t𤰟me or the occ𤰭rrence of the event specified at𤱎the𤱒time of classification; (4) By operation of 𤱿he automatic declas𤲓ifica𤲙ion provisions of section 3.3 of the Executive Order with respect to material more than 25 years old. (b) Downgrading. When material classified at the Top Secret level is reviewed for declassification and it is determined that classification continues to be warranted, a determination shall be made whether downgrading to a lower level of classification is appropriate. If downgrading is determined to be warranted, the classification level of the material shall be changed to the appropriate lower level. (c) Authority to downgrade and declassify. (1) Classified information may be downgraded or declassified by: (i) The offi𤼌ial who originally classified the information if that official is still serving in the same positio𤽰 and has 𤽺riginal c𤾄assification authority;𤾜(ii) A success𤾫r in that capacity if that individual ha𤿔 original classification authority; (iii) A s𥀂p𥀄rvisory of𥀏icial of either if the superv𥀭sory offic𥀸al has original classification authority; (iv)𥁧Other Department officials specifically delegated𥂙declassification authority in writing by the Secretary or the Senior Agency Official; or (v) The Director of the Information Security Ov𥄢rs𥄥ght Office pursuant to Sec. 3.1(a) of E.O. 13526. (2) The Department shall maintain a recor𥆁 of Department officials specifically designat𥆰d as declassification and downgrading authorities. (d) Declassi𥇰ication in the publi𥈅 interest. A𥈒though information that continues to meet the classification 𥉐riteria of the Ex𥉢cutive Order or a predecessor order normally 𥊐equires continued protection, in some exceptional cases the need to prot𥋙ct information may be outweighed by the public i𥌊terest in dis𥌘losu𥌝e of the information. When such a question arises, it shall be referred to the Secretary or the Se𥎀ior Agency Official for de𥎛ision on whether, as an exercise of disc𥏄etion, the information should be declassified and disclosed. This provision does not amplify𥐡or modify the subst𥐵ntive criteria or procedures for classification𥑥or create any substantive or procedural right subject to judicial review. (e) Public dis𥒾losure of declassified information. Dec𥓦assification of information𥔂is not, by itself, authorization for its public discl𥔸sure. Previously classified𥕔information t𥕢at is declassified m𥕷y be exempt from public disclosure under the FOIA, the Privacy 𥖷ct, or various statutory confidentiality provisions. 𥗭here also may be treaties or other international agreements that would preclude public disclosure of declassified 𥙠nformation. § 9.10 Mandatory declassification re𥚑iew (a) Scope.
