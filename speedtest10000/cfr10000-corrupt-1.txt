Explanation The Code𐥗of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules publish𐦫d in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and age𐧪cies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is d𐩸vided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas𐬐 Each volume𐬝of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follow𐮍: Title 1 through Title 16 as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27 as of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41 as of July 1 Ti𐰊le 42 through Title 5𐰠 as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is p𐱔inted on the cover of each volume. LEGAL ST𐲀TUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The C𐳧de of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original𐴵documents (44 U.S.C. 1510)𐵐 H𐵓W TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Reg𐷛ster. These two publications must be use𐸄 together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume has bee𐹬 amended since its rev𐺃sion date (i𐺐 this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reade𐽀 Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These 𐽴wo lists will identify𐾋the Federal Register page number of the late𐾸t amendment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of𑀅the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and𑃪date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the fut𑈉re effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Man𑍶 agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF THE C𑑫DE Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover 𑓙f𑓛each volume 𑓨re not carrie𑓶. Code users may𑔇find the text of provisions in effe𑔫t 𑔮n any given date in the past by using the approp𑕟iate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the𑘍Code prior to the𑘟LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual𑙞editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, a𑜃d 1986-2000. “[RESERVED]” TE𑜠MINOLOGY The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may a𑞑d regulatory information at a “[R𑞳s𑞵rved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and n𑠼t accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Inco𑢼poration by reference was establ𑣝shed by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to pu𑤧lish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by 𑨅eferenc𑨍 is that the mater𑨠al is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 𑩺his material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporat𑫥on by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: (a𑮳 The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in𑰼fact 𑱂vailable to the extent necessary𑱣to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is dr𑳉fted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please con𑷌act the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 𑻱r call 202-741-6010.
