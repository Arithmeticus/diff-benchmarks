Explanation The Code𐥗of Federal Regulations𐥮is a codification of the general and permanent𐦝rules publish𐦫d in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and age𐧪cies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which𐨳represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is d𐩸vided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering s𐫸ecific regu𐬄atory areas𐬐 Each volume𐬝of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follow𐮍: Title 1 through Title 16 as of January 1 Title𐮾17 through Title 27 a𐯔 of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41 as of July 1 Ti𐰊le 42 through Title 5𐰠 as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is p𐱔inted on the cover of each volume. LEGAL ST𐲀TUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The C𐳧de of Federal Regulations is prima facie 𐴑vidence of the text 𐴦f the original𐴵d𐴷cuments (44 U.S.C. 1510)𐵐 H𐵓W TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of𐶈Federal Regulations is kept u𐶦 to date by the individual issues of the Federal Reg𐷛ster. These two publ𐷰cations must be use𐸄 together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume 𐹥as bee𐹬 amended since its re𐺂𐺃sion date (i𐺐 this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issu𐻭d monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reade𐽀 Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These 𐽴wo lists will identify𐾋the Federal Register page number of the late𐾸t amendment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of𑀅the Code contains amendments p𑀤blished in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Fe𑃘eral Register and𑃪date of 𑃳ublication. Publicati𑄉n dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective dat𑆴 is beyond the cu𑇆-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the fut𑈉re effective date. In those in𑈨tances where a regulation published in the F𑉕deral Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 198𑋺 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies𑌦to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Man𑍶 agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the C𑏢R. These OMB numbers are p𑏽aced as close𑐋a𑐍 possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF THE C𑑫DE Provisions𑑹of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as 𑒰f the revision date stated on the cover 𑓙f𑓛each volume 𑓨re not carrie𑓶. Code users may𑔇find the text of provisions in eff𑔪𑔫𑔬 𑔮n any given date in the past by using the approp𑕟iate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR vo𑗵ume. For changes to the𑘍Code prior to the𑘟LSA listings at the end of the v𑙀lume, consult previous annual𑙞editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, a𑜃d 1986-2000. “[RESERVED]” TE𑜠MINOLOGY The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may a𑞑d regulatory information at a “[R𑞳s𑞵rved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” 𑟭s used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and n𑠼t accidentally dropped due 𑡘o a printing or co𑡫puter error. INCO𑡽PORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Inco𑢼poration by reference was establ𑣝shed by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to pu𑤧lish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already 𑥳ublished elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must 𑧔p𑧖rove it. The legal effect of incorporation by 𑨅eferenc𑨍 is that the mater𑨠al is treated as if it we𑨺e publ𑩁shed in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 𑩺his material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporat𑫥on by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: (a𑮳 The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of materi𑯵l published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in𑰼fact 𑱂vailable to the extent necessary𑱣to affor𑱬 fairnes𑱵𑱶and uniformity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is dr𑳉fted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the material incorporated by reference ca𑵀not be found? If you have an𑵝 problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please con𑷌act the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If𑸘 after contacting the agency, you find the mate𑹈ial is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 𑻱r call 202-741-6010.
