Thus, 22 CFR 1.1 refers to title 22, part 1, section 1. Explanation The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general𐆿and permanent rules published in the Federal Register𐇵by the Executive depa𐈋tments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Fede𐊉al regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency.𐋯Each chapter is f𐌁rther subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each𐍷calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:𐎿Title 1 through Ti𐏒le 16 as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27 as𐀝of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41 as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50 as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULA𐆿IONS The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to da𐇵e by the individual i𐈋sues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.𐊉To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2𐋯19), consult the 𐌁List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which app𐍷ars in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two𐎿lists will identif𐏒 the Federal Register page number of the latest am𐀝ndment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by th𐆿 user in determining the actual effective date. In in𐇵tances where the effe𐈋tive date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those ins𐊉ances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an a𐋯propriate note wi𐌁l be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires F𐍷deral agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 𐎿ollection request.𐏒Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB c𐀝ntrol numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the 𐆿ast by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Aff𐇵cted (LSA). For the c𐈋nvenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Cod𐊉 prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For𐋯changes to the Co𐌁e prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-198𐍷, and 1986-2000. “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY The term “[Reserved]” is used𐎿as a place holder 𐏒ithin the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency m𐀝y add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish re𐆿ulations in the Federal Register by referring to mate𐇵ials already publishe𐈋 elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incor𐊉oration by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal R𐋯gister (5 U.S.C. 𐌁52(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporatio𐍷 by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an inc𐎿rporation by refer𐏒nce only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 ar𐀝 met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if 𐆿he material incorporated by reference cannot be found𐇵 If you have any prob𐈋em locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 𐊉ssued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the mat𐋯rial is not avail𐌁ble, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi R𐍷ad, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010. CFR INDEXES AND 𐎿ABULAR GUIDES A su𐏒ject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is c𐀝ntained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids.

Pursuant𐎿to section 2658 of𐏒title 22 of the U.S.C., the authority of the Secre𐀝ary of State to perform the function of designation of official guests is hereby delegated to the Chief of Protocol. (22 U.S.C. 2658) [45 FR 55716, Aug. 21, 1980] § 2.5 Records. The Chief of Protocol shall maintain as a part of the official files of the Department of State a cumulative roster of all persons who have been duly notified as foreign officials or designated as official guests under this part.

Th𐏒se regulations provide basic standards for employe𐀝s of the Department of State, the United States International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA), the Agency for International Development (AID), and the International Communication Agency (USICA), their spouses (unless separated) and their dependents to accept and retain gifts and decorations from foreign governments. § 3.2 Authority. (a) Section 515(a)(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1978 (91𐆿Stat. 862-866), approved August 17, 1977, (hereafter 𐇵eferred to as “the Ac𐈋”) amended section 7342 of title 5, U.S. Code (1976), making substantial changes in the law relating to the acceptance and re𐊉ention of gifts and decorations from foreign governments. (b) 5 U.S.C. 7342(g) authorizes each employ𐋯ng agency to pres𐌁ribe regulations as necessary to carry out the new law. § 3.3 Definitions. When used in this part, the following term𐍷 have the meanings indicated: (a) Employee means (1) an officer or empl𐎿yee of the Departm𐏒nt, AID, IDCA, or USICA, including an expert or co𐀝sultant, however appointed, and (2) a spouse (unless separated) or a dependent of such a person, as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 152). (b) Foreign government means: (1) Any unit of foreign governmental authority, including any foreign national, State, local, or municipal government; (2) any international or multinational organization whose membership is composed of any uni𐆿 of foreign government as described in paragraph (b)(𐇵) of this section; (3𐈋 any agent or representative of any such unit or organization, while acting as such; (c) Gift means a tangible or intangible 𐊉resent (other than a decoration) tendered by, or received from, a foreign government; (d) Decoration 𐋯eans an order, de𐌁ice, medal, badge, insignia, emblem or award tendered by, or received from, a foreign government; (e) Minimal value m𐍷ans retail value in the United States at the time of acceptance of $100𐎿or less, except th𐏒t on January 1, 1981, and at 3-year intervals ther𐀝after, “minimal value” is to be redefined in regulations prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the immediately preceding 3-year period. § 3.4 Restriction on acceptance of gifts and decorations. (a) An employee is prohibited from requesting or otherwise encouraging the tender of a gift or decoration from a𐆿foreign government. An employee is also prohibited fr𐇵m accepting a gift or𐈋decoration from a foreign government, except in accordance with these regulations. (b) An employee may accept and retain a gi𐊉t of minimal value tendered and received as a souvenir or mark of courtesy, subject, however, to the 𐋯ollowing restrict𐌁ons— (1) Where more than one tangible item is included in a single presentation, the entire presentation shall be con𐍷idered as one gift, and the aggregate value of all items taken together𐎿must not exceed “m𐏒nimal value”. (2) The donee is responsible for det𐀝rmining that a gift is of minimal value in the United States at the time of acceptance. However, should any dispute result from a difference of opinion concerning the value of a gift, the employing agency will secure the services of an outside appraiser to establish whether the gift is one of “minimal value”. If, after an appraisal has been made, it is established that the value of the gift in question is $200 or 𐆿ore at retail in the United States, the donee will be𐇵r the costs of the ap𐈋raisal. If, however, the appraised value is established to be less than $200, the employing agency will bear the costs. (c) A𐊉 employee may accept a gift of more than minimal value when (1) such gift is in the nature of an educ𐋯tional scholarshi𐌁 or medical treatment, or (2) it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or other𐍷ise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States, except𐎿that a tangible gi𐏒t of more than minimal value is deemed to have bee𐀝 accepted on behalf of the United States and, upon acceptance, shall become the property of the United States. (d) An employee may accept gifts of travel or expenses for travel taking place entirely outside the United States (such as transportation, food, and lodging) of more than minimal value if such acceptance is appropriate, consistent with the interests of the United States, and permitted by the employing age𐆿cy. Except where the employing agency has specific in𐇵erests which may be f𐈋vorably affected by employee travel wholly outside the United States, even though it would not normally authorize its employe𐊉s to engage in such travel, the standards normally applied to determine when proposed travel will be 𐋯n the best intere𐌁ts of the employing agency and of the United States Government shall be applied in approving acceptance of travel or 𐍷ravel expenses offered by a foreign government. (1) There are two circu𐎿stances under whic𐏒 employees may accept gifts of travel or expenses:𐀝(i) When the employee is issued official travel orders placing him or her in the position of accepting travel or travel expenses offered by a foreign government which are directly related to the authorized purpose of the travel; or (ii) When the employee's travel orders specifically anticipate the acceptance of additional travel and travel expenses incident to the authorized travel. (2) When an employee is traveli𐆿g under circumstances described in paragraph (d)(1)(i𐇵 of this section, tha𐈋 is, without specific instructions authorizing acceptance of additional travel expenses from a foreign government, the employ𐊉e must file a report with the employing angency under the procedures prescribed in § 3.6. (e) Since t𐋯ngible gifts of m𐌁re than minimal value may not lawfully become the personal property of the donee, all supervisory officials shall, in𐍷advising employees of their responsibilities under the regulations, imp𐎿ess upon them thei𐏒 obligation to decline acceptance of such gifts, w𐀝enever possible, at the time they are offered, or to return them if they have been sent or delivered without a prior offer. All practical measures, such as periodic briefings, shall be taken to minimize the number of gifts which employees must deposit and which thus become subject to disposal as provided by law and regulation. Employees should not accept gifts of more than minimal value on the assumption that refu𐆿al would be likely to “cause offense or embarrassment𐇵or otherwise adversel𐈋 affect the foreign relations of the United States”. In many instances it should be possible, by explanation of the prohibiti𐊉n against an employee's retention of such gifts, to avoid consequences of acceptance, including possi𐋯le return of the 𐌁ift to the donor. Refusal of the gift at the inception should typically be regarded as in the interest both of the fo𐍷eign government donor and the U.S. Government. § 3.5 Designation of off𐎿cials and offices 𐏒esponsible for administration of foreign gifts and𐀝decorations. (a) The Act effects a significant degree of decentralization of administration relative to the disposal of foreign gifts and decorations which become U.S. Government property. Each agency is now responsible for receiving from its employees deposits of foreign gifts of more than minimal value, as well as of foreign decorations not meeting the statutory criteria for retention by the recipient. The agenc𐆿 is also responsible for disposing of this property b𐇵 return to the donor,𐈋for retaining it in the agency if official use of it is approved, for reporting to the General Services Administration within𐊉30 calendar days after deposit items neither disposed of nor retained, and for assuming custody, prop𐋯r care and handli𐌁g of such property pending removal from that custody pursuant to disposal arrangements by the General Services Admini𐍷tration. The Secretary of State, however, is made responsible for provi𐎿ing guidance to ot𐏒er executive agencies in the development of their 𐀝wn regulations to implement the Act, as well as for the annual publication of lists of all gifts of more than minimal value deposited by Federal employees during the preceding year. [See § 3.5(c).] Authority for the discharge of the Secretary's responsibilities is delegated by these regulations to the Chief of Protocol. (b) The Office of the Chief of Protocol retains primary responsibility for administration of th𐆿 Act within the Department of State. That Office will𐇵 however, serve as th𐈋 depository only for those foreign gifts and decorations which are turned in by State Department employees. The Director of P𐊉rsonnel Services of the USICA will have responsibility for administration of the Act within that agen𐋯y and will serve 𐌁s the depository of foreign gifts and decorations. Employees of the other foreign affairs agencies must deposit with 𐍷heir respective agencies any gifts or decorations deposit of which is r𐎿quired by law. (c)𐏒Any questions concerning the implementation of the𐀝e regulations or interpretation of the law should be directed to the following: (1) For the Department of State, to the Office of Protocol or to the Office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Management, as appropriate; (2) For IDCA, to the Office of the General Counsel; (3) For AID, to the Assistant General Counsel for Employee and Public Affairs; and (4) For USICA, to the General Counsel. § 3.6 Procedure to be fo𐆿lowed by employees in depositing gifts of more than m𐇵nimal value and repor𐈋ing acceptance of travel or travel expenses. (a) An employee who has accepted a tangible gift of more than minimal value shal𐊉, within 60 days after acceptance, relinquish it to the designated depository office for the employin𐋯 agency for dispo𐌁al or, with the approval of that office, deposit it for official use at a designated location in the employing agency𐍷or at a specified Foreign Service post. The designated depository offic𐎿s are: (1) For the𐏒Department of State, the Office of Protocol; (2) F𐀝r IDCA, the General Services Division of the Office of Management Planning in AID; (3) For AID, the General Services Division of the Office of Management Planning; and (4) For USICA, the Office of Personnel Services. (b) At the time that an employee deposits gifts of more than minimal value for disposal or for official use pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or within 30 days after accepting a gift of trave𐆿 or travel expenses as provided in § 3.4(d) (unless t𐇵e gift of such travel𐈋or travel expenses has been accepted in accordance with specific instructions from the Department or agency), the employee sh𐊉ll file a statement with the designated depository office with the following information: (1) For eac𐋯 tangible gift re𐌁orted: (i) The name and position of the employee; (ii) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justifyi𐍷g acceptance; (iii) The identity of the foreign government and the name𐎿and position of th𐏒 individual who presented the gift; (iv) The date 𐀝f acceptance of the gift; (v) The donee's best estimate in specific dollar terms of the value of the gift in the United States at the time of acceptance; and (vi) Disposition or current location of the gift. (For State Department employees, forms for this purpose are available in the Office of Protocol.) (2) For each gift of travel or travel expenses: (i) The name and position of the employee; (ii) A brief descrip𐆿ion of the gift and the circumstances justifying acce𐇵tance; and (iii) The 𐈋dentity of the foregign government and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift. (c) The information co𐊉tained in the statements called for in paragraph (b) of this section is needed to comply with the sta𐋯utory requirement𐌁that, not later than Janaury 31 of each year, the Secretary of State publish in the Federal Register a comprehensive 𐍷isting of all such statements filed by Federal employees concerning gif𐎿s of more than min𐏒mal value received by them during the preceding ye𐀝r. § 3.7 Decorations. (a) Decorations tendered in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance may be accepted, retained, and worn by an employee, subject to the approval of the employing agency. Without such approval, the decoration is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States and, like tangible gifts of mo𐆿e than minimal value, must be deposited by the employ𐇵e with the designated𐈋depository office for the employing agency within sixty days after acceptance, for retention for official use or for disposal𐊉in accordance with § 3.9. (b) The decision as to whether a decoration has been awarded for outstandin𐋯 or unusually mer𐌁torious performance will be made: (1) For the Department of State, by the supervising Assistant Secretary of State or𐍷comparable official, except that, in the case of a decoration awarded t𐎿 an Assistant Secr𐏒tary or other officer of comparable or higher rank𐀝 the decision shall be made by the Office of Protocol; (2) For IDCA, by the Assistant Director for Administration; (3) For AID, by the Director of Personnel Management; and (4) For USICA, by the Supervising Associate Director, the General Counsel, or the Director of the Office of Congressional and Public Liaison (for domestic employees), and by the Director of Area Offices (for overseas employees). (c) To justify 𐆿n affirmative decision, a statement from the foreign 𐇵overnment, preferably𐈋in the form of a citation which shows the specific basis for the tender of the award, should be supplied. An employee who has𐊉received or been tendered a decoration should forward to the designated depository office of the empl𐋯ying agency a req𐌁est for review of the case. This request should contain a statement of circumstances of the award and such documentat𐍷on from the foreign government as has accompanied it. The depository of𐎿ice will obtain th𐏒 decision of the cognizant office as to whether th𐀝 award meets the statutory criteria and thus whether the decoration may be retained and worn. Pending receipt of that decision, the decoration should remain in the custody of the recipient. § 3.8 Approval of retention of gifts or decorations with employing agency for official use. (a) At the request of an overseas post or an office within the employing agency, a gift or decoration deemed to have been accepted on b𐆿half of the United States may be retained for officia𐇵 use. Such retention 𐈋hould be approved: (1) For the Department of State, by the Chief of Protocol; (2) For IDCA, by AID's Director of Management O𐊉erations; (3) For AID, by the Director of Management Operations; and (4) For USICA, by the Associate 𐋯irector for Manag𐌁ment. However, to qualify for such approval, the gift or decoration should be an item which can be used in the normal𐍷conduct of agency business, such as a rug or a tea service, or an art o𐎿ject meriting disp𐏒ay, such as a painting or sculpture. Personal gift𐀝items, such as wristwatches, jewelry, or wearing apparel, should not be regarded as suitable for “official use”. Only under unusual circumstances will retention of a decoration for official use be authorized. Every effort should be made to place each “official use” item in a location that will afford the largest number of employees, and, if feasible, members of the public, the maximum opportunity to receive the be𐆿efit of its display, provided the security of the loc𐇵tion is adequate. (b)𐈋Items approved for official use must be accounted for and safeguarded as Federal property at all times under standard Federal𐊉property management procedures. Within 30 days after the official use of a gift has been terminated, 𐋯he gift or decora𐌁ion shall be deposited with the designated depository office of the employing agency to be held pending completion of𐍷disposal arrangements by the General Services Administration. § 3.9 Dis𐎿osal of gifts and 𐏒ecorations which become the property of the United𐀝States. (a) Gifts and decorations which have been reported to an employing agency shall either be returned to the donor or kept in safe storage pending receipt of instructions from the General Services Administration for transfer, donation or other disposal under the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 377, as amended, and the Federal Property Management Regulations𐆿(41 CFR part 101-49). The employing agency shall exam𐇵ne each gift or decor𐈋tion and the circumstances surrounding its donation and assess whether any adverse effect upon the foreign relations of the U𐊉ited States might result from a return of the gift (or decoration) to the donor, which shall be the p𐋯eferred means of 𐌁isposal. If this is not deemed feasible, the employing agency is required by GSA regulations to report deposit of the𐍷gift or decoration within 30 calendar days, using Standard Form 120, Re𐎿ort of Excess Pers𐏒nal Property and, as necessary, Standard Form 120A𐀝 Continuation Sheet, and citing section 7342 of title 5, U.S. Code (1976), on the reporting document. Such reports shall be submitted to the General Services Administration, Washington National Capital Region (WDPO), Attention: Federal Property Resources Service, Seventh and D Streets, SW., Washington, DC 20407. (b) No gift or decoration deposited with the General Services Administration for disposal may be sold w𐆿thout the approval of the Secretary of State, upon a 𐇵etermination that the𐈋sale will not adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States. When depositing gifts or decorations with the desi𐊉nated depository office of their employing agency, employees may indicate their interest in participa𐋯ing in any subseq𐌁ent sale of the items by the Government. Before gifts and decorations may be considered for sale by the General Servi𐍷es Administration, however, they must first have been offered for trans𐎿er to Federal agen𐏒ies and for donation to the States. Consequently, 𐀝mployees should understand that there is no assurance that an item will be offered for sale, or, if so offered, that it will be feasible for an employee to participate in the sale. Employees are reminded in this connection that the primary aim of the Act is to discourage employees' acceptance of gifts of more than minimal value. § 3.10 Enforcement. (a) Each employing agency is responsible under the Act for reporti𐆿g to the Attorney General cases in which there is rea𐇵on to believe that on𐈋 of its employees has violated the Act. The Attorney General in turn may file a civil action in any United States District Co𐊉rt against any Federal employee who has knowingly solicited or accepted a gift from a foreign governm𐋯nt in violation o𐌁 the Act, or who has failed to deposit or report such gift, as an Act required by the Act. In such case, the court ma𐍷 assess a maximum penality of the retail value of a gift improperly sol𐎿cited or received,𐏒plus $5,000. (b) Supervisory officials at all leve𐀝s within employing agencies shall be responsible for providing periodic reorientation of all employees under their supervision on the basic features of the Act and these regulations, and for ensuring that those employees observe the requirements for timely reporting and deposit of any gifts of more than minimal value they may have accepted. (c) Employees are advised of the following actions which may result from f𐆿ilure to comply with the requirements of the Act and 𐇵hese regulations: (1)𐈋Any supervisor who has substantial reason to believe that an employee under his or her supervision has violated the reporting𐊉or other compliance provisions of the Act shall report the facts and circumstances in writing to the 𐋯enior official in𐌁charge of administration within the cognizant bureau or office or at the post abroad. If that official upon investiga𐍷ion decides that an employee who is the donee of a gift or is the recip𐎿ent of travel or t𐏒avel expenses has, through actions within the empl𐀝yee's control, failed to comply with the procedures established by the Act and these regulations, the case shall be referred to the Attorney General for appropriate action. (2) In cases of confirmed evidence of a violation, whether or not such violation results in the taking of action by the Attorney General, the senior administrative official referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section as responsible for forw𐆿rding a violation report to the Attorney General shal𐇵 institute appropriat𐈋 disciplinary action against an employee who has failed to (i) Deposit tangible gifts within 60 days after acceptance, (ii) a𐊉count properly for the acceptance of travel expenses or (iii) comply with the Act's requirements resp𐋯cting disposal of𐌁gifts and decorations retained for official use. (3) In cases where there is confirmed evidence of a violation, but n𐍷 evidence that the violation was willful on the part of the employee, t𐎿e senior administr𐏒tive official referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of t𐀝is section shall institute appropriate disciplinary action of a lesser degree than that called for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section in order to deter future violations by the same or another employee. § 3.11 Responsibility of chief of mission to inform host government of restrictions on employees' receipt of gifts and decorations. A special provision of the Act requires the President to direct every chief of a 𐆿nited States diplomatic mission to inform the host go𐇵ernment that it is a 𐈋eneral policy of the United States Government to prohibit its employees from receiving gifts of more than minimal value or de𐊉orations that have not been tendered “in recognition of active field service in time of combat operat𐋯ons or awarded fo𐌁 other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.” Accordingly, all Chiefs of Mission shall in January of each𐍷year conduct a thorough and explicit program of orientation aimed at ap𐎿ropriate officials𐏒of the host government concerning the operation of𐀝the Act. § 3.12 Exemption of grants and other foreign government assistance in cultural exchange programs from coverage of foreign gifts and decorations legislation. The Act specifically excludes from its application grants and other forms of assistance “to which section 108A of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 applies”. See 22 U.S.C. 2558 (a) and (b) for the terms and conditions under whic𐆿 Congress consents to the acceptance by a Federal emp𐇵oyee of grants and ot𐈋er forms of assistance provided by a foreign government to facilitate the participation of such employee in a cultural exchan𐊉e.

(a) The United States Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 8) prohibit𐆿 the acceptance of civil employment with a foreign go𐇵ernment by an officer𐈋of the United States without the consent of Congress. Congress has consented to the acceptance of civil employment (and compe𐊉sation therefor) by any person described in § 3a.1(b) subject to the approval of the Secretary concer𐋯ed and the Secret𐌁ry of State (37 U.S.C. 801, Note).

Gen. 139 (𐊉964)). This forfeiture is in addition to any other penalty which may be imposed under law or regulati𐋯n. 1 1 Approval u𐌁der this part does not constitute an exception to the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act concerning lo𐍷s of United States citizenship, for example, by becoming a citizen of o𐎿 taking an oath of𐏒allegiance to another country. See 8 U.S.C. 1481 e𐀝 seq. § 3a.3 Authority to approve or disapprove proposed foreign government employment.

The Director may delegate this authority within the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, Department 𐆿f State. § 3a.4 Procedure for requesting approval. (a𐇵 An applicant must su𐈋mit a request for approval of foreign government employment to the Secretary concerned, whose approval is also required by la𐊉 for the applicant's acceptance of civil employment from a foreign government. The request must conta𐋯n information con𐌁erning the applicant's status, the nature of the proposed employment in as much detail as possible, the identity of a𐍷d relationship to the foreign government concerned, and other matters a𐎿 may be required b𐏒 the Secretary concerned. (b) Requests approved by𐀝the Secretary concerned will be referred to the Director, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, for approval. Requests received by the Director, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, directly from an applicant will be initially forwarded to the Secretary concerned, or his designee, for approval of disapproval. § 3a.5 Basis for approval or disapproval. Decisions by the Director, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, u𐆿der this part shall be based on whether the applicant𐇵s proposed employment𐈋with a foreign government would adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States, in light of the applicant's offi𐊉ial status as a retiree or reservist. § 3a.6 Notification of approval.

Source: 79 FR 35936, June 25, 2014, unless otherwise noted. § 9.1 Basis. The regulations in this part, taken together with 32 CFR part 2001 and Volume 5 of the Department's Foreign Affairs Manual, provide the basis for the security classification program of the U.S. Department of State (“the Department”) implementing Executive O𐆿der 13526 on Classified National Security Information𐇵(“the Executive Order𐈋 or “the Order”). § 9.2 Objective. The objective of the Department's classification program is to ensure that national securi𐊉y information is protected from unauthorized disclosure, but that it remains classified only to the e𐋯tent and for such𐌁a period as is necessary. § 9.3 Senior agency official. The Executive Order requires that each agency that originates𐍷or handles classified information designate a Senior Agency Official to𐎿direct and adminis𐏒er its information security program. The Departmen𐀝's senior agency official is the Under Secretary of State for Management. The Senior Agency Official is assisted in carrying out the provisions of the Executive Order and the Department's information security program by the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, the Assistant Secretary for Administration, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Information Services. § 9.4 Original classification. (a) D𐆿finition. Original classification is the initial dete𐇵mination that certain𐈋information requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security (i.e., national defense 𐊉r foreign relations of the United States), together with a designation of the level of classification𐋯 (b) Classificati𐌁n levels. (1) Top Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be exp𐍷cted to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that 𐎿he original classi𐏒ication authority is able to identify or describe.𐀝(2) Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe. (3) Confidential shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classific𐆿tion authority is able to identify or describe. (c) C𐇵assification requirem𐈋nts and considerations. (1) Information may not be considered for classification unless its unauthorized disclosure could rea𐊉onably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security in accordance𐋯with section 1.2 𐌁f the Executive Order, and it pertains to one or more of the following: (i) Military plans, weapons systems, or opera𐍷ions; (ii) Foreign government information; (iii) Intelligence activitie𐎿 (including covert𐏒action), intelligence sources or methods, or crypt𐀝logy; (iv) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources; (v) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security; (vi) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities; (vii) Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the𐆿national security; or (viii) The development, product𐇵on, or use of weapons𐈋of mass destruction. (2) In classifying information, the public's interest in access to government information must be balanc𐊉d against the need to protect national security information. (3) The unauthorized disclosure of forei𐋯n government info𐌁mation is presumed to cause damage to national security. (d) Classification limitations and prohibitions. (1) In no c𐍷se shall information be classified in order to conceal violations of la𐎿, inefficiency, or𐏒administrative error, or to prevent embarrassment 𐀝o a person, organization, or agency, to restrain competition, or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security. (2) A reference to classified documents that does not directly or indirectly disclose classified information may not be classified or used as a basis for classification. (3) Only information owned by, produced by or for, or under 𐆿he control of the U.S. Government may be originally c𐇵assified. (e) Duratio𐈋 of classification. (1) Information shall be classified for as long as is required by national security considerations, subje𐊉t to the limitations set forth in section 1.5 of the Executive Order. When it can be determined, a sp𐋯cific date or eve𐌁t for declassification in less than 10 years shall be set by the original classification authority at the time the in𐍷ormation is originally classified. If a specific date or event for decl𐎿ssification cannot𐏒be determined, information shall be marked for dec𐀝assification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision except for: (i) Information that would reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source, or key design concepts of weapo𐆿s of mass destruction, in which case the duration of 𐇵lassification shall b𐈋 up to 75 years and shall be designated with the markings “50X1-HUM” and “50X2-WMD,” respectively; and (ii) Specific informat𐊉on incorporated into the classification guide under section 2.2(e) of the Executive Order relating to𐋯exemptions from a𐌁tomatic declassification. (2) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification up to 25𐍷years from the date of origin of the document, change the level of clas𐎿ification, or recl𐏒ssify specific information only when the standards𐀝and procedures for classifying information under the Executive Order are met. (3) No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor orders, such as “Originating Agency's Determination Required” (OADR) or classified information that contains incomplete declassification instructions or lacks declassification instructions, shall be dec𐆿assified in accordance with Part 3 of the Order. § 9.𐇵 Original classificat𐈋on authority. (a) Authority for original classification of information as Top Secret may be exercised by the Secretary and th𐊉se officials delegated this authority in writing by the Secretary. Such authority has been delegated 𐋯o the Deputy Secr𐌁taries, the Under Secretaries, the Counselor, Assistant Secretaries and equivalents; Chiefs of Mission and U.S. repre𐍷entatives to international organizations; and certain other officers wi𐎿hin the Department𐏒and at posts abroad. (b) Authority for original cl𐀝ssification of information as Secret or Confidential may be exercised only by the Secretary, the Senior Agency Official, and those officials delegated this authority in writing by the Secretary or the Senior Agency Official. Such authority has been delegated to Deputy Assistant Secretaries, Principal Officers at consulates general and consulates abroad, and certain other officers within the Department and at posts𐆿abroad. In the absence of the Secret or Confidential 𐇵lassification authori𐈋y, the person designated to act for that official may exercise that authority. § 9.6 Derivative classification. (a) Definitio𐊉. Derivative classification is: the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating in new form𐋯information that 𐌁s already classified and the marking of the new material consistent with the classification of the source material, o𐍷 the marking of the information in accordance with an authorized classi𐎿ication guide. Dup𐏒ication or reproduction of existing classified inf𐀝rmation is not derivative classification. Persons who apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide need not possess original classification authority. (b) Responsibility. Information classified derivatively from other classified information shall be classified and marked in accordance with instructions from an authorized classifier or in accordance with an aut𐆿orized classification guide and shall comply with the𐇵standards set forth i𐈋 sections 2.1-2.2 of the Executive Order and 32 CFR 2001.22. The duration of classification of a document classified by a der𐊉vative classifier using a classification guide shall not exceed 25 years except for: (1) Information 𐋯hat would reveal 𐌁he identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source (50X1-HUM) or key design concepts of weapon𐍷 of mass destruction (50X2-WMD), and (2) Specific information incorpora𐎿ed into the classi𐏒ication guide under section 2.2(e) of the Executiv𐀝 Order relating to exemptions from automatic declassification. (c) Department of State Classification Guide. The Department of State Classification Guide (DSCG) is the primary authority for the classification of information in documents created by Department of State personnel. The Guide is classified “Confidential” and is found on the Department of State's classified Web site. § 9.7 Identification and marking. (a𐆿 Classified information shall be marked pursuant to t𐇵e standards set forth𐈋in section 1.6 of the Executive Order, 32 CFR part 2001, subpart C, and internal Department guidance in 5 Foreign Affairs Man𐊉al. (b) Foreign government information shall retain its original classification markings or be marked𐋯and classified at𐌁a U.S. classification level that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the entity t𐍷at furnished the information. Foreign government information retaining 𐎿ts original classi𐏒ication markings need not be assigned a U.S. class𐀝fication marking provided the responsible agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings. (c) Information assigned a level of classification under predecessor executive orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings. (d) Prior to public release, all declassified𐆿records shall be appropriately marked to reflect thei𐇵 declassification. § 𐈋.8 Classification challenges. (a) Challenges. Authorized holders of information pertaining to the Department of State who bel𐊉eve that its classification status is improper are expected and encouraged to challenge the classific𐋯tion status of th𐌁 information. Such persons making challenges to the classification status of information shall not be subject to retr𐍷bution for such action. Informal, usually oral, challenges are encourag𐎿d. Formal challeng𐏒s to classification actions shall be in writing to𐀝an original classification authority (OCA) with jurisdiction over the information and a copy of the challenge shall be sent to the Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS) of the Department of State, SA-2, 515 22nd St. NW., Washington, DC 20522-8100. The Department (either the OCA or IPS) shall provide an initial response in writing within 60 calendar days. (b) Appeal procedures and time limits. A negativ𐆿 response may be appealed to the Department's Appeals𐇵Review Panel (ARP) an𐈋 should be sent to: Chairman, Appeals Review Panel, c/o Director, Office of Information Programs and Services/Appeals Officer𐊉 at the IPS address given above. The appeal shall include a copy of the original challenge, the respo𐋯se, and any addit𐌁onal information the appellant believes would assist the ARP in reaching its decision. The ARP shall respond within 9𐍷 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. A negative decision by the ARP𐎿may be appealed to𐏒the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Pa𐀝el (ISCAP) referenced in section 5.3 of Executive Order 13526. If the Department fails to respond to a formal challenge within 120 calendar days or if the ARP fails to respond to an appeal within 90 calendar days, the challenge may be sent directly to the ISCAP. (c) Pre-publication review materials. The provisions for classification challenges do not apply to material required to be submitted for pre-publication r𐆿view, or other administrative action, pursuant to a n𐇵n-disclosure agreemen𐈋. § 9.9 Declassification and downgrading. (a) Declassification processes. Declassification of classified information may occu𐊉: (1) After review of material in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, mandatory 𐋯eclassification r𐌁view request, discovery request, subpoena, classification challenge, or other information access or declassification 𐍷equest; (2) After review as part of the Department's systematic declass𐎿fication review pr𐏒gram; (3) As a result of the elapse of the time or𐀝the occurrence of the event specified at the time of classification; (4) By operation of the automatic declassification provisions of section 3.3 of the Executive Order with respect to material more than 25 years old. (b) Downgrading. When material classified at the Top Secret level is reviewed for declassification and it is determined that classification continues to be warranted, a determination shall be made wh𐆿ther downgrading to a lower level of classification i𐇵 appropriate. If down𐈋rading is determined to be warranted, the classification level of the material shall be changed to the appropriate lower leve𐊉. (c) Authority to downgrade and declassify. (1) Classified information may be downgraded or declassi𐋯ied by: (i) The o𐌁ficial who originally classified the information if that official is still serving in the same position and has origi𐍷al classification authority; (ii) A successor in that capacity if that 𐎿ndividual has orig𐏒nal classification authority; (iii) A supervisory 𐀝fficial of either if the supervisory official has original classification authority; (iv) Other Department officials specifically delegated declassification authority in writing by the Secretary or the Senior Agency Official; or (v) The Director of the Information Security Oversight Office pursuant to Sec. 3.1(a) of E.O. 13526. (2) The Department shall maintain a record of Department officials specifically designa𐆿ed as declassification and downgrading authorities. (𐇵) Declassification in𐈋the public interest. Although information that continues to meet the classification criteria of the Executive Order or a pred𐊉cessor order normally requires continued protection, in some exceptional cases the need to protect in𐋯ormation may be o𐌁tweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information. When such a question arises, it shall be referred t𐍷 the Secretary or the Senior Agency Official for decision on whether, a𐎿 an exercise of di𐏒cretion, the information should be declassified an𐀝 disclosed. This provision does not amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification or create any substantive or procedural right subject to judicial review. (e) Public disclosure of declassified information. Declassification of information is not, by itself, authorization for its public disclosure. Previously classified information that is declassified may be exempt from public disclos𐆿re under the FOIA, the Privacy Act, or various statut𐇵ry confidentiality pr𐈋visions. There also may be treaties or other international agreements that would preclude public disclosure of declassified i𐊉formation. § 9.10 Mandatory declassification review (a) Scope. All information classified under E.O. 𐋯3526 or predecess𐌁r orders shall be subject to mandatory declassification review upon request by a member of the public or a U.S. gover𐍷ment employee or agency with the following exceptions: (1) Information 𐎿riginated by the i𐏒cumbent President or the incumbent Vice President;𐀝the incumbent President's White House staff or the incumbent Vice President's staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent President; other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the incumbent President; (2) Information that is the subject of pending litigation; and (3) Information that has been reviewed for declassification within the past two y𐆿ars which need not be reviewed again, but the request𐇵r shall be given appe𐈋l rights. (b) Requests.

Authority: 22 U.S.C. 4047(d); 22 U.S.C. 4071(b); 5 U.S.C. 8470(b); 5 CFR 845.301-07. Source: 71 FR 16229, Mar. 31, 2006, unless otherwise noted. § 17.1 General. This part establishes procedures for notifying individuals of𐆿their rights if they have received an overpayment fro𐇵 the Foreign Service 𐈋etirement and Disability Fund under Chapter 8 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended, including their right to contes𐊉 the determination that there has been an overpayment and the right to request a waiver of recovery o𐋯 the overpayment.𐌁This part also provides the procedures for administrative determination of these rights and for appeals of negative d𐍷terminations. § 17.2 Conditions for waiver of recovery of an overpaymen𐎿. (a) Foreign Serv𐏒ce Retirement and Disability System. Recovery of a𐀝 overpayment from the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund under the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System may be waived pursuant to section 4047(d), of title 22, United States Code when the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience or administratively infeasible. (b) Foreign Service Pension System. Recovery of an overpayment from the Foreign Service 𐆿etirement and Disability Fund under the Foreign Servi𐇵e Pension System may 𐈋e waived pursuant to section 4071(b) of title 22, United States Code and section 8470(b) of title 5, United States Code when 𐊉he individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. (c) When it 𐋯as been determine𐌁 that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual is nevertheless entitled to an adjustm𐍷nt in the recovery schedule if he or she shows that it would cause him 𐎿r her financial ha𐏒dship to make payment at the rate scheduled. § 17.𐀝 Fault. A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he or she performed no act of commission or omission that resulted in the overpayment. The fact that the Department of State or other agency may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will not necessarily relieve the individual from liability. (a) Considerations. Pertinent considerations in finding fault are— (1) Whether payment resulted from the i𐆿dividual's incorrect but not necessarily fraudulent s𐇵atement, which he/she𐈋should have known to be incorrect; (2) Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose material facts in h𐊉s/her possession which he/she should have known to be material; or (3) Whether he/she accepted a paym𐋯nt which he/she k𐌁ew or should have known to be erroneous. (b) Mitigation factors. The individual's age, physical and mental condition 𐍷r the nature of the information supplied to him or her by the Departmen𐎿 of State or a Fed𐏒ral agency may mitigate against finding fault if o𐀝e or more contributed to his or her submission of an incorrect statement, a statement which did not disclose material facts in his or her possession, or his or her acceptance of an erroneous overpayment. § 17.4 Equity and good conscience. (a) Defined. Recovery is against equity and good conscience when— (1) It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought; (2) The recipient of the overpayment𐆿can show (regardless of his or her financial circumst𐇵nces) that due to the𐈋notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment either he/she has relinquished a valuable right or𐊉changed positions for the worse; or (3) Recovery could be unconscionable under the circumstances. (b)𐋯[Reserved] § 17.5𐌁Financial hardship. (a) Waiver of overpayment will not be allowed in any case prior to receipt and evaluation of a co𐍷pleted Statement of Financial Status, duly sworn by the recipient of th𐎿 overpayment. (b) 𐏒inancial hardship may be deemed to exist in, but n𐀝t limited to, those situations where the recipient from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his or her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. (1) Considerations. Some pertinent considerations in determining whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows: (i) The individual's financial ability to pay at the time colle𐆿tion is scheduled to be made. (ii) Income to other fa𐇵ily member(s), if suc𐈋 member's ordinary and necessary living expenses are included in expenses reported by the individual. (c) Exemptions. Assets 𐊉xempt from execution under State law should not be considered in determining an individual's ability 𐋯o repay the indeb𐌁edness, rather primary emphasis shall be placed upon the individual's liquid assets and current income in making such𐍷determinations. § 17.6 Ordinary and necessary living expenses. An indiv𐎿dual's ordinary an𐏒 necessary living expenses include rent, mortgage 𐀝ayments, utilities, maintenance, food, clothing, insurance (life, health and accident), taxes, installment payments, medical expenses, support expenses when the individual is legally responsible, and other miscellaneous expenses which the individual can establish as being ordinary and necessary. § 17.7 Waiver precluded. (a) Waiver of an overpayment cannot be granted when: (1) The overpayment was obtained by fraud;𐆿or (2) The overpayment was made to an estate. (b) [Re𐇵erved] § 17.8 Burdens𐈋of proof. (a) Burden of the Department of State. The Bureau of Resource Management, Department of State, must establish by th𐊉 preponderance of the evidence that an overpayment occurred. (b) Burden of individual. The recipient 𐋯f an overpayment 𐌁ust establish by substantial evidence that he or she is eligible for waiver or an adjustment in the recovery schedule𐍷 § 17.9 Procedures. (a) Notice. The Bureau of Resource Management, Depa𐎿tment of State, sh𐏒ll give written notification to any individual who𐀝has received an overpayment promptly by first-class mail to the individual at the individual's most current address in the records of the Bureau of Resource Management. The written notice shall inform the individual of: (1) The amount of the overpayment; (2) The cause of the overpayment; (3) The intention of the Department to seek repayment of the overpayment, (4) The date by which payment should be made to avoid 𐆿he imposition of interest, penalties, and administrat𐇵ve costs; (5) The app𐈋icable standards for the imposing of interest, penalties, and administrative costs; (6) The department's willingness to discu𐊉s alternative payment arrangements and how the individual may offer to enter into a written agreement𐋯to repay the amou𐌁t of the overpayment under terms acceptable to the Department; and (7) The name, address and telephone number of a co𐍷tact person within the Bureau of Resource Management. The written notic𐎿 also shall inform𐏒the individual of their right to contest the overp𐀝yment, their right to request a waiver of recovery of the overpayment, and the procedures to follow in case of such contest or request for waiver of recovery. The notification shall allow at least 30 days from its date within which the individual may contest in writing the overpayment or request a waiver of recovery, including with their submission all evidence and arguments in support of their position. (b) Admin𐆿strative file. The Bureau of Resource Management will𐇵prepare an administra𐈋ive file as a basis for determination in each case where an individual contests a claim to recover overpayment or requests wa𐊉ver of recovery of the overpayment. On the basis of the administrative file, the Chief Financial Offi𐋯er or his or her 𐌁elegate, shall make the final administrative determination. (c) Additional information. At any time before the final 𐍷dministrative decision, the Department may request the individual to su𐎿plement his or her𐏒submission with additional factual information and𐀝may request that the individual authorize the Department of State to have access to bank and other financial records bearing on the application of these regulations. If the individual, without good cause shown, fails or refuses to produce the requested additional information or authorization, the Department of State is entitled to make adverse inferences with respect to the matters sought to be amplified, clarifie𐆿, or verified. (d) Decision and right of appeal. The 𐇵inal administrative d𐈋cision shall be reduced to writing and sent to the individual. If the decision is adverse to the individual, the notification𐊉of the decision shall include a written description of the individual's rights of appeal to the Forei𐋯n Service Grievan𐌁e Board. The Foreign Service Grievance Board shall consider any appeal under this part in accordance with the regulat𐍷ons of the Board set forth in 22 CFR part 901.

If a participant or former participant beco𐎿es divorced on or 𐏒fter February 15, 1981, he/she shall notify the De𐀝artment (PER/ER/RET) of the divorce on or prior to its effective date. The notice shall include the effective date of the divorce, the full name, mailing address, and date of birth of the former spouse and the date of the member's marriage to that person, and enclose a certified copy of the divorce decree. If there is a court order or spousal agreement concerning payment or nonpayment of Foreign Service benefits t𐆿 the former spouse, the original or a certified copy 𐇵f the order or agreem𐈋nt shall also be forwarded to PER/ER/RET. In the absence of a court order or spousal agreement providing otherwise, the Depar𐊉ment will pay a pro rata share of the member's benefits to the former spouse. (A former spouse of a f𐋯rmer participant 𐌁ho separated from the Service on or before February 15, 1981 is not eligible for a pension under § 19.9, i.e., not el𐍷gible for a pro rata share of the principal's annuity.) Upon receipt of𐎿notice of a divorc𐏒, a court order, or spousal agreement, the Departm𐀝nt will proceed as indicated in § 19.6 or § 19.7. Delinquent notice to the Department of the divorce of an annuitant will result in retroactive payments to any qualified former spouse to the extent that the retroactive payments can be deducted from future annuity payments to the principal as stated in § 19.6-4. § 19.5-2 Notification to Department from former spouses. A former spouse is obligated to notify the Depa𐆿tment of the following on a timely basis: (a) A divor𐇵e from a participant 𐈋r former participant when the former spouse is notified by the court of the divorce before the participant is notified; (b) A𐊉y change in address; and (c) Any remarriage. Notices shall be sent to the Department of State, Attent𐋯on PER/ER/RET, Wa𐌁hington, DC 20520. § 19.5-3 Residence of spouse during service at unhealthful post. (a) The calculation of the pro ra𐍷a share of benefits for a former spouse, and the determination of wheth𐎿r a person qualifi𐏒s as a “former spouse” depends on the length of th𐀝 marriage. The latter, under the definition in the Act and when the principal has received extra service credit for an assignment to an unhealthful post, depends upon whether a spouse has resided with the principal at the unhealthful post. In order to determine residency for this purpose, whenever a married participant is assigned to an unhealthful post for which he/she does not receive post differential and does 𐆿eceive or request extra service credit, the participa𐇵t shall report on For𐈋 OF-140, Election to Receive Extra Service Credit Towards Retirement, whether his/her spouse is or is not residing at the pos𐊉. Although a chief of mission is not required to submit Form OF-140 in order to receive extra credit 𐋯or service at an 𐌁nhealthful post, he/she must nevertheless submit this form if the chief of mission has a spouse that does not accompa𐍷y him/her at post for the entire assignment. Both the participant and s𐎿ouse shall sign th𐏒 completed form. If there is a change in residence𐀝of the spouse during the assignment, a new joint Form OF-140 shall be filed to report the change. (b) Whenever a participant retires or becomes divorced, or whenever a former participant becomes divorced who has extra service credit for assignment at unhealthful posts completed prior to the issuance of this regulation who was married during at least a portion of the assignment, the participant or former participan𐆿 shall submit a statement to PER/ER/RET reporting on 𐇵hether his/her spouse𐈋resided at the unhealthful post and the dates of such residence. The statement shall be signed by the principal and his/her s𐊉ouse or former spouse whenever possible. (c) In the event of a disagreement between a principal and h𐋯s/her spouse or f𐌁rmer spouse concerning residency at an unhealthful post, or the submission of a report or statement by a principal sh𐍷wing a period of nonresidence at a post by a spouse which is not signed𐎿by the spouse, the𐏒determination of residence will be made by PER/ER/𐀝ET and based on records in the Department of payments for travel and allowances plus any other evidence that can be adduced. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the assumption will be made that the spouse resided at the post. § 19.6 Court orders and divorce decrees. § 19.6-1 Orders by a court. (a) A court may— (1) Fix the amount of any pension to a former spouse under § 19.9, or order that none be paid𐆿 (2) Fix the amount of any regular survivor annuity t𐇵 a former spouse unde𐈋 paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 19.11, or order that none be paid; (3) Order provision of an additional survivor annuity for a s𐊉ouse or former spouse under § 19.10-5; (4) Fix the amount of any benefit under § 19.10-6 based on rec𐋯ll service payabl𐌁 to a former spouse to whom the annuitant was married during any portion of the recall service, or order that none be𐍷paid; (5) Fix the amount of any lump-sum payable to a former spouse und𐎿r § 19.13 or order𐏒that none be paid; (6) Order, to the extent consis𐀝ent with any obligation stated in § 19.8 between a participant and a former spouse, and pursuant to any court decree of divorce, legal separation or annulment or any court ordered or approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, legal separation, or annulment, that any payment from the Fund which would otherwise be made to a former participant based on his/her service shall be pai𐆿 (in whole or in part) by the Secretary of State to a𐇵previous spouse or ch𐈋ld of such participant. No apportionment under this paragraph may be made of a payment authorized to be paid to a survivor of𐊉a participant or annuitant. (b) An order by a court that does not meet the definition of “court” in §𐋯19.2(f) is not va𐌁id for purposes of this section even though a divorce decree issued by such court may be a basis for pro rata share p𐍷yments to a former spouse as described in these regulations. § 19.6-2 Q𐎿alifying court ord𐏒r. (a) To be valid for purposes of this section, a𐀝court order must be found to be “qualified” by PER/ER/RET acting for the Secretary of State. A qualifying court order must— (1) Be consistent with the terms of the Act and applicable regulations; (2) Not direct payment of an amount in excess of the maximum amount authorized to be paid by the relevant regulation; (3) Direct that payments be made to an eligible beneficiary from a principal's Foreign Service retireme𐆿t benefit or survivor benefit. If a court directs or 𐇵mplies that a princip𐈋l, rather than the Secretary of State or the Government, make the payments, the order will not be considered qualified unless𐊉the principal does not object during the 30-day notice period provided under § 19.6-6; (4) Define the𐋯amount to be paid𐌁to a beneficiary in way so that it can be readily calculated from information in the normal files of the Department; 𐍷5) Not make payment contingent upon events other than those on which ot𐎿er payments from t𐏒e Fund are based such as age, marital status and s𐀝hool attendance; and (6) Not be in conflict with any previously issued court order which remains valid. (b) No apportionment of annuity to a beneficiary under § 19.6-1(a) (1) or (6) shall exceed the net annuity of the principal. The net annuity is computed by excluding from the gross annuity the amounts which are: (1) Owed by the individual to the United States; (2) Deducted for health benefits premiums pursuant t𐆿 section 8906 of Title 5, United States Code; (3) Ded𐇵cted for life insuran𐈋e premiums under the Government Life Insurance Program; (4) Owed due to overpayment of annuity; (5) Properly withheld for Fed𐊉ral income tax purposes, if amounts withheld are not greater than they would be if the individual cla𐋯med all dependent𐌁 to which he/she was entitled.

(a) To receive payment from the Fund pu𐎿suant to a court a𐏒ard, the beneficiary must submit an application in𐀝writing to the Chief of the Retirement Division (PER/ER/RET), Department of State, Washington, DC 20520. The application must be typed or printed, signed by the beneficiary, and include— (1) The full name, date of birth, current address and current marital status of the beneficiary; (2) Full name and date of birth of the participant or former participant and his/her date of birth or other identifying information; 𐆿3) Relationship to the beneficiary, and if a spouse o𐇵 former spouse, date 𐈋f marriage to and/or divorce from the participant; (4) A statement that the court order has not been amended, superseded, or 𐊉et aside; The original of the court order or a recently certified copy must be enclosed with the appl𐋯cation, or a stat𐌁ment appended that such a copy has been sent to the Department by other means. (b) When payments are subject to termi𐍷ation upon the occurrence of a condition subsequent, such as marriage, 𐎿emarriage or termi𐏒ation of schooling, or death of the principal, no 𐀝ayment will be made until the beneficiary submits a statement to PER/ER/RET that— (1) The condition has not occured; (2) He/she will notify the Department (PER/ER/RET) within 15 calendar days of the occurrence of the condition subsequent; and (3) He/she will be personally liable for any overpayment to him/her resulting from the occurrence of the condition subsequent. PER/ER/RET may require periodic recertification𐆿of these statements. § 19.6-4 Date of court orders. (𐇵) A court order direc𐈋ing or barring payment of a pension to a former spouse under § 19.9 may not be given effect by the Department if it is issued𐊉more than 12 months after the divorce becomes final. A court order adjusting the amount of a regular 𐋯r additional surv𐌁vor annuity to a former spouse under § 19.11-2 or § 19.10-5 may not be given effect by the Department if it is issued𐍷after the death of the principal. (b) A court order issued within 12 mo𐎿ths after a divorc𐏒 becomes final directing payment of a pension to a𐀝former spouse in an amount other than provided in § 19.9 may be made retroactively effective to the first of the month in which the divorce becomes final if so specified by the court. In such event, the Department will adjust any future payments that may become due to an annuitant and a former spouse by increasing one and correspondingly reducing the other in order to give effect to the order of the court. However𐆿 if future payments to one party are not due, as for 𐇵xample if a court ord𐈋rs that no payments be made to a former spouse, or that 100 percent of an annuity be paid as pension to a former spouse, the 𐊉epartment will not give retroactive effect to a court order by collecting overpayments from one party𐋯in order to pay t𐌁em to the other party and will not make overpayments from the Fund. (c) A court order under this chapter involving an𐍷 payment other than a pension to a former spouse under § 19.9 may not b𐎿 given retroactive𐏒effect and shall not be effective until it is dete𐀝mined to be a qualifying order under § 19.6-5. § 19.6-5 Preliminary review. (a) Upon receipt of an application for payment under § 19.6-3, PER/ER/RET will determine whether— (1) The application is complete; (2) The applicant is an eligible beneficiary under this chapter; and (3) The court order is a qualifying order. If the application is completed, the beneficiary is eligible and the court order appears on its fa𐆿e to be a qualifying order, PER/ER/RET will provide t𐇵e notification requir𐈋d by § 19.6-6, otherwise, it will notify the applicant of any deficiency or requirement for additional information, and if th𐊉 order is determined to be non-qualifying, the basis for such determination. (b) Upon receipt of a ce𐋯tified copy of a 𐌁inal decree of divorce, PER/ER/RET will determine whether— (1) It is a valid decree. Any decree recognized as valid b𐍷 the parties will be considered valid for this purpose. In addition, an𐎿 non-recognized de𐏒ree will be considered valid for this purpose unle𐀝s: (i)(A) Neither party was domiciled within the court's jurisdiction, and (B) The party denying recognition did not participate in the proceedings, or (ii) The party denying recognition was not afforded notice of the proceedings (actual or constructive); (2) A related court order has been submitted by either party; and (3) A pro rata share payment is or may become due the former spouse. If a divorce decree is dee𐆿ed valid under this paragraph, a pro rata share payme𐇵t is due a former spo𐈋se unless PER/ER/RET is in receipt of a court order which it has deemed qualified under paragraph (a) of this section, or a v𐊉lid spousal agrement providing otherwise. If it determines that a pro rata share payment is due, it w𐋯ll provide the no𐌁ification required by § 19.6-6, otherwise, unless action is being taken pursuant to a related court order, it will no𐍷ify both parties to the divorce the reason a pro rata share payment is 𐎿ot payable. [46 FR𐏒12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 𐀝6 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981] § 19.6-6 Notification. (a) Notification to a principal. Whenever PER/ER/RET receives from a former spouse or other eligible beneficiary— (1) a court order which it deems qualified that requires payment to the beneficiary; or (2) A final decree of divorce which it deems valid together with a request for a pro rata share payment—PER/ER/RET will send a copy of the document to the principal 𐆿nd a notice stating: (i) That PER/ER/RET deems the or𐇵er qualified or the d𐈋vorce decree valid, (ii) that payments will be made from the principal's account to the beneficiary and the effective date of𐊉such payments, (iii) the effect of such payments on the principal's retirement benefit. In the case o𐋯 any court order 𐌁ith retroactive or immediate effect, and in the case of pro rata share payments, the amounts will be withheld from fu𐍷ure payments to the principal but will not be paid to the beneficiary f𐎿r 30 days from the𐏒notice date in order to give the principal an oppo𐀝tunity to contest the court order or the validity of the divorce. PER/ER/RET will provide the former spouse or other beneficiary the same information, stating the exact amount that will be payable to the beneficiary and explaining how that amount was calculated. (b) Notification to a former spouse. When PER/ER/RET receives from a principal—(1) a court order which it deems qualified that requires or forbids payment𐆿to a former spouse; or (2) a final decree of divorce 𐇵hich it deems valid w𐈋thout an accompanying court order—PER/ER/RET will send a copy of the document to the former spouse and a notice stating: (i) 𐊉hat PER/ER/RET deems the court order qualified or the divorce decree valid, (ii) that PER/ER/RET inte𐋯ds to honor the c𐌁urt decree or to make pro rata share payments because of the divorce, (iii) the effective date, exact amount, and met𐍷od of calculation of any payments to the former spouse. PER/ER/RET will𐎿provide the same i𐏒formation to the principal and will explain the ef𐀝ect any payment to a former spouse will have on the principal's retirement benefit. § 19.6-7 Decision. (a) When a response has not been received by PER/ER/RET from a principal within the 30-day period under § 19.6-6a, payment will be made in accordance with the notification. When a response is received, the Chief, PER/ER/RET will consider the response. If it is shown that a court order is not qualifying or that a 𐆿ivorce is not valid under terms of the Act and these 𐇵egulations, payment p𐈋oposed in the notification will not be made. In such a case, PER/ER/RET will advise both parties of the basis for its decisio𐊉 and the alternative action, if any, that it proposes to take. (b) If a principal responding to a not𐋯fication under § 𐌁9.6-6a objects to the payment or other action proposed by the Department in the notification based on the validity of𐍷the court order or divorce decree, and the record contains support for 𐎿he objection, PER/𐏒R/RET will grant the principal 30 days to initiate𐀝formal legal action to determine the validity of the objection, will continue to delay payment to the former spouse or other beneficiary during this period, and will notify the beneficiary of this action. If evidence is submitted that formal legal action has been started within the 30-day period, the amount of any proposed payment to a former spouse or other beneficiary will continue to be withheld from any paymen𐆿s due the principal, but no payment will be made to t𐇵e former spouse or ot𐈋er beneficiary until a judicial decision is rendered or agreement reached between the parties. [46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. R𐊉designated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981] § 19.6-8 Allotment to beneficiary. If a court o𐋯der is not a qual𐌁fying court order because it directs or implies that payment to the beneficiary is to be made by the principal rather𐍷than the Secretary of State, the principal may make an allotment to the𐎿beneficiary from h𐏒s/her annuity. An annuitant may also make an allot𐀝ent from his/her annuity to a previous spouse in the absence of a court order. § 19.6-9 Limitations. (a) Retirement benefits are subject to apportionment by court order under § 19.6-1(a)(6) only while the principal is living. Payment of apportioned amounts will be made only to a previous spouse and/or the children of the principal. Such payments will not be made to any of the following: (1) Heirs or legatees of th𐆿 previous spouse; (2) Creditors of either the princip𐇵l or the previous spo𐈋se; or (3) Assignees of either the principal or the previous spouse. (b) The amount of any court ordered payment may not be l𐊉ss than one dollar and, in the absence of compelling circumstances, shall be in whole dollars. (c) In𐋯honoring and comp𐌁ying with a court order, the Department shall not be required to disrupt the scheduled method of accruing retirement 𐍷enefits or the normal timing for making such payments, despite the exis𐎿ence of any specia𐏒 schedule relating to a previous spouse or other b𐀝neficiary. (d) In cases where the court order apportions a percentage of the retirement benefits, PER/ER/RET will initially determine the amount of proper payment. That amount will only be increased by future cost-of-living increases unless the court directs otherwise. § 19.6-10 Liability. (a) The Department shall not be liable for any payment made from retirement benefits pursuant to a court order if such payment𐆿is made in accordance with the provisions of this cha𐇵ter. (b) In the event𐈋that the Secretary is served with more than one court order with respect to the same retirement benefits, the benefits shall 𐊉e available to satisfy the court orders on a first-come, first-served basis. (c) A previous spouse or𐋯other beneficiary𐌁may request that an amount be withheld from the retirement benefits of a principal or survivor of a principal which i𐍷 less than the amount stipulated in a court order, or otherwise schedul𐎿d to be paid to th𐏒 beneficiary under this chapter. This lower amount𐀝will be deemed a complete fulfillment of the obligation of the Department for the period in which the request is in effect. See § 19.14. § 19.7 Spousal agreements. § 19.7-1 Purpose. A spousal agreement may be used by both parties to establish an agreed-upon level of benefits to a spouse or a former spouse and to relieve the participant of responsibility for providing a higher level of benefits. § 19.7-2 Agreement 𐆿ith spouse. (a) A spousal agreement between a partici𐇵ant and a spouse may 𐈋aive or fix the level of a regular survivor annuity under § 19.11-3. If an agreement is filed, it will assure the spouse that𐊉the agreed-upon level of survivor annuity will be paid, irrespective of a future divorce provided the𐋯survivor meets th𐌁 definition of “former spouse” in § 19.2(k). If an agreement is not filed, the participant's annuity will be reduced 𐍷nder § 19.10-2 to provide the maximum regular survivor annuity for the 𐎿pouse, but in the 𐏒vent of a future divorce if the spouse meets the d𐀝finition of “former spouse,” that person will be entitled only to a pro rata share of the survivor annuity. An agreement under this paragraph may be filed with PER/ER/RET at any time prior to retirement (commencement of the principal's annuity). (b) A spousal agreement between an annuitant and a spouse filed with PER/ER/RET before commencement of a supplemental annuity for recall service may waive a supplemental s𐆿rvivor annuity that would otherwise be provided for a𐇵spouse under § 19.10-𐈋. (c) A spousal agreement between a participant or former participant and a spouse may be filed with PER/ER/RET at any time i𐊉 accordance with § 19.10-5 and provide for an additional survivor annuity for the spouse. (d) A spous𐋯l agreement filed𐌁under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) remains valid and binding in the event of divorce if the spouse qualifies as a forme𐍷 spouse. § 19.7-3 Agreement with former spouse. (a) A spousal agreement𐎿between a particip𐏒nt or former participant and a former spouse may w𐀝ive, reduce or increase the following benefits for a former spouse; (1) A pension under § 19.9; (2) A regular survivor annuity under § 19.11-2; (3) A supplemental survivor annuity under § 19.10-6; (4) A lump sum payment for regular or recall service under § 19.13. A spousal agreement shall also be used by a participant or former participant who has a former spouse on February 15, 1981, to elect a regular survivor 𐆿nnuity for such former spouse in accordance with § 19𐇵11-2(e). An agreement𐈋to establish or increase any benefit for a former spouse entered into while the principal is married to someone else, must be𐊉signed and agreed to by both the spouse and the former spouse. An agreement affecting pension benefit𐋯 may be filed at 𐌁ny time and will govern payments made after its acceptance by PER/ER/RET. An agreement affecting a regular survivor a𐍷nuity must be filed before the end of the 12-month period after the div𐎿rce involving that𐏒former spouse or at the time of retirement, whiche𐀝er occurs first, except as authorized in § 19.11-2(b) for persons retired on February 15, 1981, or in § 19.11-2(e) with respect to persons who were former spouses on February 15, 1981. This filing requirement stated in the Act makes it impossible to adjust, other than by court order, a regular survivor annuity for a former spouse when the divorce occurs after a retirement which occurs on or after February 15, 1981𐆿 The survivor annuity for the former spouse in such c𐇵se is fixed by any sp𐈋usal agreement entered into prior to the divorce, by § 19.11-2 or by court order. An agreement affecting supplemental survivo𐊉 benefits or lump-sum payments must be filed before the supplemental annuity of the principal begins 𐋯r lump-sum paymen𐌁 is made. (b) A spousal agreement between a participant or former participant and a former spouse may be filed with P𐍷R/ER/RET at any time in accordance with § 19.10-5 to provide an additio𐎿al survivor annuit𐏒 for the former spouse. § 19.7-4 Form of agreement𐀝 (a) A spousal agreement is any legal agreement between the parties accepted by PER/ER/RET as meeting the requirements of this section. If in accordance with the regulations, PER/ER/RET will accept as a valid spousal agreement a property settlement agreed to by the parties and approved by a court regardless of the date of the agreement. (b) A spousal agreement must either be authenticated by a court or notarized. 𐆿 19.7-5 Limitations. (a) A spousal agreement may not 𐇵rovide for any paymen𐈋 from the Fund in excess of the amount otherwise authorized to be paid, or at a time not authorized by these regulations, or 𐊉o a person other than a spouse or former spouse. (b) A spousal agreement must be filed with the Depar𐋯ment, Attention P𐌁R/ER/RET, and accepted by that office as in conformance with the Act and these regulations prior to the times specifi𐍷d in §§ 19.7-2 and 19.7-3. That office will provide advice to the parti𐎿s on the validity 𐏒f any proposed agreement and on proper format. (c)𐀝A spousal agreement may apply only to payments from the Fund for periods after receipt of a valid agreement by the Department. (d) Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of §§ 19.6-9 and 19.6-10 apply to spousal agreements and payments made pursuant to spousal agreements to the same extent that they apply to court orders and court ordered payments. § 19.7-6 Duration and precedence of spousal agreements. (a) A spousal agreeme𐆿t may be revised or voided by agreement of the partie𐇵 (by filing a new agr𐈋ement under this section) at any time prior to the last day for filing an agreement determined in accordance with § 19.7-2 or𐊉§ 19.7-3, except spousal agreements for additional survivor annuities are irrevocable. After the last𐋯day for filing a 𐌁articular agreement, such agreement is irrevocable. (b) A valid spousal agreement entered into subsequent to the issu𐍷nce of a court order affecting the same parties will override the court𐎿order, and shall g𐏒vern payments from the Fund. (c) A spousal agreeme𐀝t may not override a previous spousal agreement involving the same principal but a different spouse or former spouse without agreement of such spouse or former spouse. § 19.8 Obligations of members. Participants and former participants are obligated by the Act and these regulations to provide the following benefits to others and must accept the necessary reductions in their own retirement benefits to meet these ob𐆿igations: (a) A pension to a former spouse pursuant t𐇵 § 19.9; (b) A court 𐈋rdered apportionment of annuity to a previous spouse or child under § 19.6-1 (a)(6) (the benefit to a child referred to here 𐊉s paid during the annuitant's lifetime as distinguished from the automatic survivorship annuity to a 𐋯hild described in𐌁§ 19.11-7); (c) A regular survivor annuity to a former spouse who has not remarried prior to age 60, and to a spouse 𐍷o whom married when annuity commences, pursuant to §§ 19.11-2 and 19.11𐎿3; (d) An addition𐏒l survivor annuity for a spouse or former spouse u𐀝der § 19.10-5 when elected by the participant or ordered by a court; (e) Lump-sum payments to a former spouse pursuant to § 19.13; (f) Benefits ordered by a court under § 19.6 or specified in a spousal agreement under § 19.7. § 19.9 Pension benefits for former spouses. § 19.9-1 Entitlement. (a) Unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement under § 19.7 or a court order under § 19.6, a person who, afte𐆿 February 15, 1981, becomes a former spouse of a part𐇵cipant (or former par𐈋icipant who separated from the Service after February 15, 1981) and who has not remarried prior to becoming 60 years of age, 𐊉ecomes entitled to a monthly pension benefit effective on a date determined under § 19.9-2 in an amou𐋯t determined unde𐌁 § 19.9-3. (b) A former spouse shall not be qualified for a pension under this subsection if, before the commencement𐍷of that pension, the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years o𐎿 age. (c) A pensio𐏒 benefit under this section is treated the same as𐀝a survivor annuity for purposes of § 19.11-5(b): a former spouse who elects to receive a pension under this section must waive simultaneous receipt of any survivor annuity. [46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981] § 19.9-2 Commencement and termination. (a) The pension of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the latter of the day the principal becomes entitl𐆿d to a Foreign Service annuity or on the first day of𐇵the month in which th𐈋 divorce becomes final. (Suspension or reduction of a Foreign Service annuity because or reemployment does not affect the com𐊉encement of a pension to a former spouse.) In the case of any former spouse of a disability annuitant𐋯 the pension of s𐌁ch former spouse shall commence on the latter of: (1) The date the principal would qualify for an annuity (other than𐍷a disability annuity) on the basis of his/her creditable service; (2) T𐎿e date the disabil𐏒ty annuity begins; or (3) The first of the month i𐀝 which the divorce becomes final. (b) The pension of a former spouse and the right thereto terminate on: (1) The last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 60 years of age; or (2) The date the annuity of the former participant terminates unless the termination results from recall, reappointment or reinstatement in the Foreign Service or reemployment in Government service. § 19.9-3 Comp𐆿tation and payment of pension to former spouse. (a) A𐇵pension to a former s𐈋ouse is paid monthly on the same date that annuity is paid to the principal. (b) No spousal agreement or court order may prov𐊉de for a pension or any combination of pensions to former spouses of any one principal which exceeds 𐋯he net annuity of𐌁the principal as defined in § 19.6-2(b). (c) A pension to a former spouse not fixed by a spousal agreement or court o𐍷der shall equal the former spouse's pro rata share of 50 percent of the𐎿annuity to which t𐏒e principal is entitled on the date the divorce be𐀝omes final, or, if not then entitled to an annuity, 50 percent of the annuity to which the principal first becomes entitled following that date. A pension to a former spouse of a disability annuitant shall be calculated on the basis of an annuity for which the participant would qualify if not disabled. A pension to a former spouse will be increased by the same percentage of each cost-of-living adjustment received 𐆿y the principal. (d) The Department will initiate pay𐇵ent of a pension to a𐈋former spouse after complying with the notification and other procedures described in § 19.6. (e) If a pension can not be pai𐊉 because a former spouse is missing, the principal may file an affidavit with PER/ER/RET that he/she 𐋯oes not know the 𐌁hereabouts of the former spouse. In such an event, the principal and the Department will follow the procedures in § 1𐍷.11-4 in an effort to locate the former spouse. The annuity of the prin𐎿ipal will be reduc𐏒d by the amount of the pension to the former spous𐀝 even though the latter is not being paid. If the former spouse has not been located during the 12-month period following the date the principal files an affidavit under this section, the annuity of the principal will be recomputed effective from its commencing date (or on the date following the last month a pension payment was made to the former spouse) and paid without reduction of the amount of pension to the f𐆿rmer spouse. If the former spouse subsequently is loc𐇵ted, pension payments𐈋to him/her will be initiated at that time at the rate that would have been payable had they been paid continuously from the o𐊉iginal effective date. The Department shall not be liable to make any pension payments to the former 𐋯pouse for the mis𐌁ing period if the procedures under this section were faithfully complied with nor will the Department be responsible 𐍷or recovering any payments made to the principal for the benefit of the𐎿former spouse. § 1𐏒.9-4 Effect on annuitant. Any pension payable to a𐀝former spouse under this section or pursuant to any spousal agreement or court order shall be deducted from the annuity of the principal. (See § 19.6-4 concerning retroactive adjustments.) If the annuity of such a principal in any month is discontinued or reduced so that the net amount payable is less than the pension to the former spouse or spouses of the principal because of recall, reappointment or reinstatment𐆿in the Foreign Service or reemployment in the Governm𐇵nt service, the princ𐈋pal's salary, rather than annuity, shall be reduced by the amount of the pension payment(s). Such salary reductions shall be 𐊉eposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Fund. If a pension to a former spouse is discontinued f𐋯r any reason exce𐌁t a suspension pending a determination of entitlement, the annuity of the principal shall be recomputed effective as 𐍷f the date of discontinuance of the pension, and paid as if the pension𐎿to the former spou𐏒e had never been deducted. § 19.10 Types of annuit𐀝es to members. § 19.10-1 Full annuity. If a participant retires and does not provide a survivor annuity to a spouse, former spouse or designated beneficiary, the participant receives a “full” annuity. A full annuity means an annuity computed without any survivorship reduction. Example: Average salary $20,000 and maximum of 35 years of service. Average basic annual salary for high 3 consecutive years of service $20𐆿000 Multiplied by 2 pct .02   $400.00 Multiplied by 3𐇵 years of creditable 𐈋ervice .35 Full annuity $14,000 § 19.10-2 Reduced annuity with regular survivor annuity to spouse or former spouse. (a) At co𐊉mencement of annuity, a participant or former participant may provide a regular survivor annuity for 𐋯ny eligible forme𐌁 spouse and, within the limits of paragraph (b) of this section, a regular survivor annuity to any spouse to whom he/𐍷he is then married as described in §§ 19.11-2 and 19.11-3, respectively𐎿 A regular survivo𐏒 annuity for a spouse or former spouse equals 55 p𐀝rcent of the portion of the retiree's annuity (up to the full amount) designated as the base for the survivor annuity. To provide the survivor annuity, the participant must accept a reduction in his/her full annuity equal to 21/2 percent of the first $3,600 of the designated base, plus 10 percent of the balance of the base. If a regular survivor annuity is being provided for both a spouse and a former spouse, the 𐆿ases for each are added and the calculation made as i𐇵 the following exampl𐈋: Participant's full annuity as computed in § 19.10-1: $14,000. Maximum regular survivor annuity is 55 percent of full annuit𐊉: $7,700. Case I (Participant has a spouse and former spouse at retirement) If the pro rata share for𐋯a former spouse i𐌁 75 percent, the base for this benefit will be 75 percent of $14,000: $10,500. The base for the maximum regular survi𐍷or annuity for a spouse would then be 25 percent of $14,000, or $3,500.𐎿Combined base: $14𐏒000. Participant's full annuity reduced as follows𐀝 21/2 percent of first $3,600 of the base: $90. Plus 10 percent of the amount over $3,600 ($14,000-3,600) $10,400: $1,040. Total reduction in participant's full annuity: $1,130. Participant's reduced annuity: $12,870. Survivor annuity for former spouse: 55 percent of $10,500 or $5,775. Survivor annuity for spouse: 55 percent of $3,500 or $1,925. Case II (Participant married at retirement with no former spouse. All𐆿calculations made without reference to cost-of-living𐇵increases described i𐈋 § 19.11-5d.) Joint election of base for regular survivor annuity of 90 percent of the maximum, or 90 percent of $14,000: $12𐊉600. Participant's full annuity reduced as follows: 21/2 percent of first $3,600 of the base: $90. Pl𐋯s 10 percent of t𐌁e amount over $3,600 ($12,600-3,600) $9,000: $900. Total reduction in participant's full annuity: $990. Participant's𐍷reduced annuity: $13,010. In this example, if divorce occurs subsequent𐎿to retirement and 𐏒 court orders a 75 percent share for the former sp𐀝use, the base for the survivor annuity for the former spouse would be 75 percent of $14,000: $10,500. The participant's full annuity would then be reduced by $780 in accordance with the above formula for this survivor benefit, and the reduced annuity would be $14,000-780: $13,220. If the former spouse qualifies for a pension as described in § 19.9 based on a pro rata share of 75 percent, the pension would equal 50𐆿percent of the participant's reduced annuity times 75𐇵percent (50% × $13,22𐈋 × 75%): 4,957.50. The participant's reduced annuity would then be further reduced by this pension ($13,220-$4,957.50) to pro𐊉ide an annuity to the former participant of $8,262.50. If this annuitant later remarried, the maximum𐋯base for the regu𐌁ar survivor annuity for the new spouse would be the amount designated at retirement, $12,600, less the amount committ𐍷d to the former spouse, $10,500: $12,600-10,500 or $2,100. The survivor𐎿annuity for this s𐏒ouse: 55 percent of $2,100 or $1,555. The election𐀝of this benefit for the new spouse would be made individually by the annuitant since a marriage after retirement does not give a spouse a right to participate in the election. If the election is made to provide a regular survivor annuity to the new spouse, all of the above calculations would be recomputed effective the first day of the month beginning one year after the date of the remarriage, as follows: Base for𐆿survivor annuity for former spouse: 75% of $14,000 or𐇵$10,500. Survivor ann𐈋ity for former spouse: 55% of $10,500 or $5,775. Base for survivor annuity for spouse: 15% of $14,000 or $2,100. Survivor ann𐊉ity for spouse: 55% of $2,100 or $1,555. The combined base for the survivor benefits is $10,500 plus 𐋯2,100 or $12,600.𐌁The annuity reduction on this combined base as computed above is $990. The participant's annuity after reduction for 𐍷urvivor benefit would be $14,000-$990 or $13,010. The pension for the f𐎿rmer spouse would 𐏒e 50% × $13,010 × 75% or $4,878.75. The participan𐀝's annuity would be further reduced by this amount: $13,010-$4,878.75 to provide an annuity after this recalculation of $8,131.25. (b) The maximum regular survivor annuity or combination of regular survivor annuities that may be provided under this section is limited to 55% of the principal's full annuity computed at retirement. If an annuitant is recalled to active duty in the Foreign Service, he/she may provide 𐆿dditional regular survivor annuities under § 19.10-6.𐇵The maximum regular s𐈋rvivor annuity or combination of regular survivor annuities that an annuitant who was married at retirement may elect or prov𐊉de, pursuant to a court order or otherwise, after retirement in the event of his/her divorce or remar𐋯iage, is limited 𐌁o the amount provided at the time of initial retirement or reversion to retired status following recall service. § 19𐍷10-3 Marriage after retirement. If an annuitant who was unmarried at th𐎿 time of retiremen𐏒, marries, he/she may within one year after such m𐀝rriage irrevocably elect to receive a reduced annuity and to provide, subject to any obligation to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse, a survivor annuity for the new spouse. If such an election is made, the principal's annuity shall be reduced in accordance with § 19.10-2 effective on the first day of the first month which begins at least one year after the date of the marriage. The reduction is comput𐆿d on the commencing rate of the principal's annuity. 𐇵 19.10-4 Death or div𐈋rce of a spouse and remarriage after retirement. (a) If the marriage of an annuitant who received a reduced annuity at retire𐊉ent under § 19.10-2 to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse is dissolved by divorce or by death of𐋯the spouse, the r𐌁tiree's annuity shall be recomputed, if necessary, as of the first of the month following the death or divorce. If th𐍷 marriage was dissolved by death, the annuity shall be recomputed and p𐎿id at its full amo𐏒nt. If the marriage is dissolved by divorce, proce𐀝ures in § 19.11-2(b) shall be followed. (b) In the event an annuitant affected by this paragraph remarries, the annuitant may elect within one year of remarriage to provide a survivor annuity for the new spouse equal in amount to the survivor benefit formerly in effect for the previous spouse less any amount committed for a former spouse. The annuity of a retiree making such an election shall be reduced effective 𐆿n the first day of the first month which begins at le𐇵st one year after the𐈋remarriage to the amount that would have been payable had there been no recomputation under paragraph (a) of this section. § 𐊉9.10-5 Reduced annuity with additional survivor annuity to spouse or former spouse. (a) General. This𐋯section provides 𐌁n opportunity for a participant or former participant who has provided a regular survivor annuity to a former spouse 𐍷o provide a survivor annuity to a second spouse or to another former sp𐎿use. The additiona𐏒 survivor annuity provided under this section gene𐀝ally is more costly than the regular survivor annuity because the participant is required to pay it's full cost by deduction from salary or annuity, or otherwise, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The participant must also be in normal health for his/her age and pass a physical examination prescribed by the Secretary of State (M/MED) to be eligible to provide an additional survivor annuity under this 𐆿ection. (b) Limitation on amount. Neither the total a𐇵ount of additional su𐈋vivor annuity or annuities under this section provided by any participant or former participant nor any combination of regula𐊉 or additional survivor annuities for any one surviving spouse or former spouse of a principal may ex𐋯eed 55 percent of𐌁the principal's full annuity counting any supplemental annuity or recomputation of annuity because of recall service.𐍷An additional survivor annuity provided by any principal shall be furth𐎿r limited to the a𐏒ount that can be provided by a monthly payment whi𐀝h is not greater than the principal's net annuity described in § 19.6-2(b). The amount of any additional survivor annuity provided by a spousal agreement effective prior to the principal's retirement, shall be reduced as necessary by PER/ER/RET after the principal's retirement to comply with this limitation. Any amount paid by a participant for the portion of additional survivor annuity cancelled pursuant to this 𐆿aragraph shall be treated as an additional lump sum p𐇵yment under paragraph𐈋(e) of this section and used to increase the amount of the additional annuity. A participant who separates from the Service w𐊉thout entitlement to any annuity is not entitled to provide an additional survivor annuity. Payments 𐋯n such a case wou𐌁d be discontinued as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (c) Procedures to grant additional survivor annuity.𐍷A participant or former participant who has provided a regular survivor𐎿annuity to a forme𐏒 spouse who wishes to provide, or who is ordered b𐀝 a court to provide an additional survivor annuity under this section to a spouse or another former spouse, shall do so by filing a spousal agreement with PER/ER/RET on a form acceptable to PER/ER/RET. Such an agreement will be irrevocable when accepted by PER/ER/RET unless the beneficiary of the additional survivor annuity is subsequently made a beneficiary of a regular survivor annuity in equal amount. Within th𐆿 limitations specified in paragraph (b) of this secti𐇵n, an individual may 𐈋e made the beneficiary of both a regular and an additional survivor annuity. A spousal agreement granting an additional survi𐊉or annuity to a spouse will remain valid in the event the marriage is dissolved and the spouse qualif𐋯es as a former sp𐌁use under the definition § 19.2(k). (d) Eligibility for additional survivor annuity. A spouse or former spouse must m𐍷et the same criteria (§ 19.2(v) or § 19.2(k)) to be eligible for an add𐎿tional survivor an𐏒uity as a spouse or former spouse must meet to be 𐀝ligible for a regular survivor annuity. Payment of a special survivor annuity will commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If it is discontinued because of remarriage, it will not be resumed. (e) Payment for additional survivor annuity. (1) Payment for an additional survivor annuity will commence on the firs𐆿 of the month following the effective date of a spous𐇵l agreement provising𐈋the additional survivor annuity. The effective date will be the date of acceptance of the spousal agreement by PER/ER-RET (up𐊉n a finding that the agreement conforms to the law and regulations) or such later date as may be spec𐋯fied in the agree𐌁ent. No payment will be made to a beneficiary under the agreement if the principal dies before its effective date. Ac𐍷ordingly, in order to give protection to a beneficiary during active se𐎿vice, the agreemen𐏒 must be made effective, and payment commence, dur𐀝ng active service. Payment will be made by a participant or annuitant by deduction from salary or annuity. Payment will be made by a former participant while awaiting commencement of a deferred annuity by direct payment to the Department, Office of Financial Operations (M/COMP/FO). Payments not received by the due date may, at the option of M/COMP/FO and with notice to the principal and the beneficiary be collecte𐆿 from the principal's lump-sum account. Amounts so co𐇵lected must be repaid𐈋by the principal with interest compounded at 10 percent annually to prevent exhaustion of the lump-sum account. If the lump-s𐊉m account does become exhausted, any rights to the lump-sum payment under § 19.13 and survivorship ri𐋯hts under this pa𐌁agraph will expire on that date. If the principal dies with an amount owing, it shall be collected by set off from th𐍷 survivor annuity or lump-sum account. (2) Monthly payments may be redu𐎿ed or eliminated b𐏒 direct payment to M/COMP/FO by any participant or𐀝former participant under terms mutually agreed upon by the participant and PER/ER/RET. Minimum monthly payments will be based upon actuarial tables prescribed from time to time by the Director General of the Foreign Service (M/DGP) with the advice of the Secretary of Treasury. Such tables will be calculated so that the present value of all payments equal the present value of the survivor annuity. If new tables are𐆿prescribed, they would be applicable to additional su𐇵vivor annuities provi𐈋ed by spousal agreements that become effective on or after the effective date of the new tables. Additional survivor annuitie𐊉 will be increased by regular cost-of-living adjustments from their commencing dates only when so spe𐋯ified at the opti𐌁n of the participant or former participant in a spousal agreement. Monthly payments will be higher if cost-of-living 𐍷djustments are provided. (3) In the event of the disqualification of a 𐎿eneficiary for an 𐏒dditional survivor annuity because of death, remar𐀝iage prior to age 60 or divorce from the principal and failure to meet the definition of “former spouse,” or in the event of an authorized reduction or cancellation of an election for an additional survivor annuity, the monthly payment for such discontinued or reduced additional survivor annuity will be discontinued or reduced, as appropriate, effective at the beginning of the first month following termination or 𐆿eduction of the benefit. Except as otherwise specifie𐇵 in paragraph (b) of 𐈋his section, any amount paid for such discontinued or reduced benefit by a participant or former participant in excess of the𐊉minimum monthly payments described above shall be refunded to the participant or former participant w𐋯th interest calcu𐌁ated at the annual rate used in the last evaluation of the System or at such higher rate as may be authorized by M/CO𐍷P/FO as will not cause a loss to the Fund. The following table illustra𐎿es the minimum mon𐏒hly payments schedule in effect February 15, 1981.𐀝Age of principal and beneficiary on effective date of spousal agreement Minimum monthly payment required to provide an additional survivor annuity of $100 per month.

(𐈋) Annuity of recalled participant. Any participant who is recalled to the Service under section 308 of the Act, shall, while 𐊉erving, be entitled in lieu of annuity to the full salary of the class in which serving. During such 𐋯ervice, the recal𐌁ed annuitant shall make contributions to the Fund under section 805(a) of the Act. If a share of the annuity is being𐍷paid as a pension to a former spouse under § 19.9, that share shall be 𐎿educted from the s𐏒lary of the recalled annuitant during the period o𐀝 the recall service. Upon reversion of the annuitant to retired status, any pension payable to a former spouse that was being deducted from the salary of the principal shall again be deducted from the annuity of the principal which shall be determined as follows: (1) If the recall service lasts less than one year, a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall period will be refunded under § 19.13 and𐆿the former annuity will be resumed at the previous ra𐇵e adjusted by any cos𐈋-of-living increases that became effective during recall service. (2) If the recall service lasts between one and five years,𐊉the annuitant will be entitled to elect benefits under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or receive bo𐋯h the former annu𐌁ty adjusted by cost-of-living increases and a supplemental annuity computed under § 19.10 on the basis of service cre𐍷it and average salary earned during the recall period, irrespective of 𐎿he number of years𐏒of service credit previously earned. (3) If the re𐀝all service lasts five years or more, the annuitant will be entitled to recomputation of the annuity as if there had been no previous retirement, or elect benefits under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section. (4) An annuitant may receive credit in any computation under paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section for any Federal service performed subsequent to the separation upon which the original annuity was comp𐆿ted provided a special contribution is made for such 𐇵ervice under section 𐈋05 of the Act. (5) An annuitant entitled to a supplemental annuity under paragraph (a)(3) of this section or a recomputated a𐊉nuity under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is obligated, in the absence of a court order or spousal𐋯agreement to the 𐌁ontrary, to have those annuities reduced to provide the benefits described in § 19.8 to any spouse or former spouse t𐍷 whom married during any portion of the recall service. An annuitant mu𐎿t accept a reducti𐏒n of 10 percent of his/her supplemental annuity in𐀝order to provide a supplemental survivor annuity to a spouse or former spouse. The maximum supplemental survivor annuity equals 55 percent of the supplemental annuity. If, upon reversion to retired status, an annuitant has a former spouse entitled to a pro rata share or some other share of the supplemental survivor annuity, but no spouse, the appropriate share of the supplemental annuity shall be reduced by 10 per𐆿ent to provide such former spouse a share of the maxi𐇵um supplemental survi𐈋or annuity. (b) Survivor benefit for death during recall service. (1) If an annuitant entitled to a reduced annuity under § 1𐊉.10-2 dies in service after being recalled and is survived by a spouse or former spouse entitled to a𐋯survivor annuity 𐌁ased on the service of such annuitant, such survivor annuity shall be computed as if the recall service had otherwise𐍷terminated on the day of death and the annuity of the deceased had been𐎿resumed in accorda𐏒ce with paragraph (a) of this section. If such dea𐀝h occurs after the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility for a supplemental annuity, a surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service shall be entitled to elect, in addition to any other benefits and in lieu of a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall service, a supplemental survivor a𐆿nuity computed and paid under § 19.10-6a(5) as if the𐇵recall service had ot𐈋erwise terminated. If the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility to have his/her annuity det𐊉rmined anew, a surviving spouse or such a surviving former spouse may elect, in lieu of any other sur𐋯ivor benefit unde𐌁 § 19.11, to have the rights of the annuitant redetermined and to receive a survivor annuity computed under § 19.11-2𐍷or § 19.11-3 on the basis of the total service of the annuitant. In the𐎿event such an annu𐏒tant is survived both by a spouse and such a forme𐀝 spouse, the former spouse will be entitled to a pro rata share of any refund or supplemental survivor benefit under this section computed on the basis of total service during the recall period and months of marriage during such period. If the surviving spouse and surviving former spouse elect different benefits under this paragraph, the former spouse will receive the pro rata share of the benefit he/she elects an𐆿 the spouse will receive the reciprocal share of the 𐇵enefit he/she elects.𐈋(2) In the event an annuitant dies during recall service and is survived by a former spouse to whom not married during any pe𐊉iod of the recall service, such former spouse will not be entitled to any benefits based on the recal𐋯 service. § 19.11𐌁Survivor benefits. § 19.11-1 Kinds of survivor benefits. If a participant or former participant dies in active servic𐍷 or after retirement, regular survivor annuities are payable under term𐎿 of this section t𐏒 an eligible surviving spouse, former spouse or ch𐀝ld. Also, if all rights to annuity and survivor annuity terminate prior to exhaustion of the participant's lump-sum credit, a lump-sum payment is made pursuant to § 19.13. In addition to the above, an additional survivor annuity, and a supplemental survivor annuity may be payable to an eligible survivor under §§ 19.10-5 and 19.10-6, respectively. If any participant or former participant makes an election, files a 𐆿pousal agreement or becomes subject to a court order 𐇵o provide a regular s𐈋rvivor annuity for a spouse or former spouse and does not subsequently become entitled to leave a survivor annuity under thes𐊉 regulations (because of separation from the Service and withdrawal of contributions, death after sep𐋯ration but before𐌁commencement of a deferred annuity, or for any other reason), none will be paid and such election, spousal agreement 𐍷r court order to provide such survivor annuity will have no force or ef𐎿ect. § 19.11-2 Reg𐏒lar survivor annuity for a former spouse. (a) Divo𐀝ce prior to retirement. If a participant or former participant is divorced prior to commencement of annuity, any former spouse shall be entitled to a pro rata share of such a principal's maximum regular survivor annuity (based on service performed prior to the first date the principal becomes eligible for an annuity following the divorce) unless a different amount is elected in a spousal agreement filed with PER/E𐆿/RET within 12 months after the divorce becomes final𐇵or at the time of the𐈋retirement, whichever occurs first, or unless a different amount is specified by a court prior to the death of the principal.𐊉The principal's annuity shall be reduced at the commencing date under § 19.10-2 in order to provide t𐋯e survivor annuit𐌁 committed to the former spouse. (b) Divorce after retirement. In the event an annuitant is divorced after retirement𐍷(commencement of annuity), the maximum survivor annuity that may be pro𐎿ided for that form𐏒r spouse is limited to the amount provided for tha𐀝 person at the time of retirement. Within that limit, the former spouse is entitled to a pro rata share of the participant's maximum survivor benefit (based on service performed prior to the divorce) unless a different amount was elected in a spousal agreement filed with PER/ER/RET at the time of retirement, or in the case of retirement before February 15, 1981, filed with PER/ER/RET within 12 months after the div𐆿rce becomes final, or unless a different amount is sp𐇵cified by a court pri𐈋r to the death of the principal. For this purpose, a joint election filed with PER/ER/RET at the time of retirement is consid𐊉red a spousal agreement. If the survivor annuity for the former spouse is reduced at the time of the 𐋯ivorce (because t𐌁e pro rata share or the amount specified in a spousal agreement or court order is less than the amount elected at ret𐍷rement), the principal's annuity shall be recomputed and paid, effectiv𐎿 on the date the s𐏒rvivor benefit is reduced, as if the lower amount 𐀝ad been elected at the outset of retirement. (c) Death or remarriage of former spouse and transfer of survivor benefit to a spouse. Remarriage below age 60 or death of a former spouse while a principal is alive will disqualify the former spouse for benefits under this section. In the event of such a remarriage or death of a former spouse, the portion of a principal's survivor annuity committed to that person will 𐆿ecome available for transfer to any spouse. If such a𐇵remarriage or death o𐈋 the former spouse occurs after the principal's annuity commences, any reduction in the principal's annuity for that former s𐊉ouse will be discontinued effective at the beginning of the first month following the remarriage or d𐋯ath unless the an𐌁uitant elects to provide or to increase a survivor benefit for a spouse. Such an election may be made within one year𐍷after the annuitant receives notice of the remarriage or death of his/h𐎿r former spouse. T𐏒e Department (PER/ER/RET) and the annuitant shall 𐀝ach notify the other promptly whenever either receives independent notice of such a remarriage or death. If an election to transfer survivor benefits to a spouse is not made by the annuitant, his/her annuity will be recomputed and paid as if there had been no reduction for the discontinued survivor benefit. If an annuity is so recomputed and an election is subsequently made to designate as beneficiary a spouse to 𐆿hom married for at least one year at the time the ele𐇵tion is made, the pri𐈋cipal's annuity shall be restored retroactively to its former, lower rate and then adjusted by cost-of-living increases that 𐊉ave occured since the date of the first recomputation. If an election is made for a spouse when the m𐋯rriage has not ye𐌁 lasted a year, the procedures in § 19.10-4 shall be followed. (d) Amount of survivor annuity. The amount of a regula𐍷 survivor annuity is determined under § 19.11-3(c). (e) Special rules f𐎿r election of surv𐏒vor annuity for a person who is a former spouse on𐀝February 15, 1981. (1) Any participant, or former participant eligible for a deferred annuity which has not yet commenced, who, on February 15, 1981 has a former spouse, may at any time prior to commencement of annuity, elect, with the consent of any spouse to whom married at the time of the election, to receive a reduced annuity and provide a regular survivor annuity for such former spouse. Such survivor annuity 𐆿hall be limited by § 19.10-2(b). An election under th𐇵s paragraph for a for𐈋er spouse will reduce the amount of any regular survivor annuity that may subsequently be provided for any spouse or other fo𐊉mer spouse. (2) Any former participant in receipt of an annuity who has a former spouse on February 1𐋯, 1981 and who ha𐌁 not committed his/her entire annuity as a base for a regular survivor annuity for a spouse or any other former spous𐍷, may, prior to December 31, 1982, designate any portion of the uncommi𐎿ted base as the ba𐏒e for a regular survivor annuity for such former s𐀝ouse. (3) The annuity of a former participant making an election under this paragraph shall be reduced under § 19.10-2(a) effective February 15, 1981, or from its commencing date if later. (4) An election under this paragraph shall be made by filing a spousal agreement with PER/ER/RET under § 19.7. A spousal agreement to provide a regular survivor annuity under this paragraph for a former spouse may be revoked or 𐆿mended after its acceptance by PER/ER/RET as in accor𐇵ance with the Act and𐈋these regulations, only by agreement of the parties up to the last day allowed by this paragraph for filing such an agreement𐊉 Thereafter, it is irrevocable. If a participant dies in service after having filed a valid election 𐋯nder this section𐌁 a survivor annuity will be paid to an eligible former suriving spouse in accordance with the terms of the election. 𐍷 19.11-3 Regular survivor annuity for a spouse. (a) In the absence of a𐎿joint election or 𐏒 spousal agreement to the contrary, a participant 𐀝r former participant who is separated from active service on or after February 15, 1981 who is married at the commencement of his/her annuity shall provide a regular survivor annuity for a spouse under § 19.10-2 equal to the maximum amount that remains available under limitations stated in paragraph (b) of that section after allowing for any commitment of a regular survivor annuity for a former spouse who has not 𐆿emarried prior to age 60 and who is alive on the date𐇵the former participan𐈋 becomes eligible for an annuity. (b) A regular survivor annuity is also payable to a surviving spouse for whom a principal e𐊉ected an annuity under § 19.10-3, § 19.10-4, or § 19.11-2(c) following a marriage after comencement o𐋯 his/her annuity.𐌁(c) The amount of a regular survivor annuity equals 55 percent of the base designated for the benefit at the time the𐍷principal's annuity commenced, adjusted by the total percentage of cost𐎿of-living increase𐏒 the principal was receiving at death. (d) A survi𐀝or annuity is payable to a surviving spouse only if that person was married to the principal at the time of his/her death or if the spouse became a former spouse under the definition in § 19.2(k). [46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981] § 19.11-4 Procedure in event a spouse or former spouse is missing. If a participant or former participant has a spouse or former spouse𐆿whose whereabouts are unknown, such participant may e𐇵ect to reduce or elim𐈋nate the share of a regular survivor annuity provided for that person under § 19.11-2 or § 19.11-3 by filing an affidavit wit𐊉 PER/ER/RET stating that his/her spouse or former spouse is missing and giving full name, last known 𐋯ddress, date last𐌁heard from, circumstances of the disappearance and a description of the effort that has been made to locate the indiv𐍷dual. Thereafter, the participant shall take such additional steps to l𐎿cate the missing p𐏒rson as may be directed by PER/ER/RET. That Office𐀝shall also attempt to locate the missing person by sending a letter to the individual's last known address given in the Department's files, to the address given on the affidavit, and, if a Social Security number is known, to the Social Security Administration for forwarding. The election and affidavit may be filed at any time before commencement of annuity. It must remain on file with PER/ER/RET for at least one y𐆿ar before being given irrevocable effect by the Depar𐇵ment. If the annuity 𐈋o the former participant becomes effective prior to the expiration of this one year period, the annuity shall be computed and𐊉paid without reference to the election filed under this section. Following this one-year period, or a𐋯 the commencement𐌁of annuity, if later, if the missing person has not been located, the affidavit may be reaffirmed by the participant,𐍷after which an election by the participant to reduce or eliminate the s𐎿are of regular sur𐏒ivor annuity for the missing person shall be given𐀝irrevocable effect by the Department. If the annuity to the former participant has commenced, it shall be recomputed and paid retroactively to give effect to any election made under this section. § 19.11-5 Commencement, termination and adjustment of annuities. (a) An annuity payable from the Fund to a surviving spouse or former spouse begins on the day after the participant or annuitant dies and stops on the last 𐆿ay of the month before the survivor's (1) marriage be𐇵ore age 60, or (2) de𐈋th. If a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, the annuity is restored at the same rate effective on the date𐊉such remarriage is terminated, provided any lump-sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned𐋯to the Fund. The 𐌁ermination of a surviving spouse annuity due to remarriage does not apply to a survivor annuitant who is a surviving 𐍷pouse of a participant who died in service or retired before October 1,𐎿1976, unless elect𐏒d following a marriage after retirement under circ𐀝mstances described in § 19.10-3 or § 19.10-4. (b) A surviving spouse or former spouse shall not become entitled to a survivor annuity or to the restoration of a survivor annuity payable from the Fund unless the survivor elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees. (For this purpose, neither the Social Security syste𐆿 nor the military retirement system is considered a r𐇵tirement system for G𐈋vernment employees.) This restriction does not apply to a survivor annuitant who is a surviving spouse of a participant who d𐊉ed in service or retired before October 1, 1976, unless the survivor annuity was elected under circum𐋯tances described 𐌁n § 19.10-3 or § 19.10-4. (c) A child's annuity begins on the day after the participant dies, or if a child is not th𐍷n qualified, on the first day of the month in which the child becomes e𐎿igible. A child's 𐏒nnuity shall terminate on the last day of the mont𐀝 which precedes the month in which eligibility ceases. (d) Regular and supplemental survivor annuities to a spouse or former spouse of an annuitant described in §§ 19.11-2, 19.11-3 and 19.10-6(b) are increased from their effective date by the cumulative percentage of cost-of-living increases the annuitant was receiving under section 826 of the Act at death. All annuities payable to survivors on the date a cost-of-𐆿iving adjustment becomes effective are increased by t𐇵at percentage except 𐈋1) the first increase to a surviving spouse of a participant who dies in service shall be pro rated and (2) additional surviv𐊉r annuities under § 19.10-5 when the spousal agreement authorizing the annuity makes no provision for𐋯cost-of-living in𐌁reases. (e) The annuity of survivors becomes effective as specified in this section but is not paid until the survivo𐍷 submits Form JF-38, Application for Death Benefits, supported by such 𐎿roof as may be req𐏒ired, for example, death, marriage, and/or divorce𐀝certificates. In the event that such is not submitted during an otherwise eligible beneficiary's lifetime, no annuity is due or payable to the beneficiary's estate. [46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981] § 19.11-6 Death during active duty. (a) Annuity for surviving former spouse. In the event a participant dies before separation from the Service and leaves a former spo𐆿se, such former spouse is entitled to a regular survi𐇵or annuity under § 19𐈋11-2 computed as if the participant had retired on the date of death unless a court order or spousal agreement is on file in 𐊉he Department waiving such entitlement or providing for some other computation, or unless the former 𐋯pouse had been fo𐌁nd missing and an election filed under the procedures of § 19.11-4 waiving a survivor benefit for that person. Any as𐍷umed service authorized to be used under paragraph (b) of this section 𐎿n computing the an𐏒uity for a surviving spouse may not be counted as 𐀝years of marriage” when determining whether the previous spouse qualifies as a “former spouse” under the definition in § 19.2(k) or when computing the pro rata share under § 19.2(s). A former spouse is entitled to an additional survivor annuity under § 19.10-5 provided death occurs on or after the effective date of a spousal agreement providing for the additional annuity. (b) Annuity for surviving spouse. If a par𐆿icipant who has at least 19 months of civilian servic𐇵 credit toward retire𐈋ent under the System, excluding extra service credited for unhealthful post duty in accordance with section 816 of the Act, d𐊉es before separation from the Service, and is survived by a spouse as defined in § 19.2(v) such survi𐋯or shall be entit𐌁ed to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the annuity computed in accordance with § 19.10-1 less any annuity payable to𐍷a former spouse under paragraph a. If the participant had less than thr𐎿e years of credita𐏒le civilian service at the time of death, the surv𐀝vor annuity is computed on the basis of the average salary for the entire period of such service. If, at time of death, the participant had less than 20 years of creditable service, the annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, but such additional service credit shall in no case exceed the difference between the participant's age on the date of death and age 65. 𐆿 spouse is entitled to an additional survivor annuity𐇵under § 19.10-5 provi𐈋ed death occurs on or after the effective date of a spousal agreement providing for the additional annuity. (c) Annuity for a𐊉child or children. If a participant described in paragraph (b) of this section is survived by a child𐋯or children, each𐌁surviving child is entitled to an annuity as described in § 19.11-7. (d) Annuity changes. Annuities based on a death 𐍷n service are subject to the provisions of § 19.11-5 governing commence𐎿ent, adjustment, t𐏒rmination and resumption of annuities. § 19.11-7 A𐀝nuity payable to surviving child or children. (a) If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit under the System dies in service, or if an annuitant who was a former participant dies, annuities are payable to a surviving child or children, as defined in § 19.2(e) as follows: (1) When survived by spouse and child or children. If a principal is survived by a wife or husband and by a child or𐆿children, in addition to any other annuity, there sha𐇵l be paid to or on be𐈋alf of each child an annuity equal to the smallest of: (i) $900 (ii) $2,700 divided by the number of children—adjusted under 𐊉aragraph (b). (2) When survived by a child or children but no spouse. If the principal is not survive𐋯 by a wife or hus𐌁and, but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smallest of: (i) $1,080 (𐍷i) $3,240 divided by the number of children—adjusted under paragraph (b𐎿 of this section. 𐏒b) Adjusted rates. In order to reflect cost-of-liv𐀝ng increases, the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) are increased from the commencing date of the annuity to each child by the cumulative percentage of all cost-of-living increases that have occurred under 5 U.S.C. 8340 since October 31, 1969. (c) Recomputation of annuity for child or children. If a surviving wife or husband dies or the annuity of a child is terminated, the annuities of any remainin𐆿 children shall be recomputed and paid as though such𐇵spouse or child had n𐈋t survived the participant. If the annuity to a surviving child who has not been receiving an annuity is initiated or resumed𐊉 the annuities of any other children shall be recomputed and paid from that date as though the annuit𐋯es to all current𐌁y eligible children in the family were then being initiated. § 19.11-8 Required elections between survivor benefits. 𐍷a) Bar against concurrent payment under this Act and Workers' Compensat𐎿on Act. Except as 𐏒tated below, survivor annuities and survivors' com𐀝ensation for work injuries under 5 U.S.C. 8102 are not payable concurrently if both are based on the death of the same employee. A survivor entitled to both must elect which of the two benefits he/she prefers. Should all eligible survivors of a deceased employee elect to receive the compensation benefit rather than the survivor annuity, their rights to the latter are terminated and, if the lump-sum credit has not 𐆿een exhausted, a lump-sum payment will become due und𐇵r § 19.13. The one ex𐈋eption to this rule occurs when a widow or widower is being paid the balance of a scheduled compensation award under 5 U.S.C.𐊉8107 due the deceased employee. If so, the widow or widower may receive the survivor annuity and comp𐋯nsation award con𐌁urrently. (b) Election between survivor annuity and social security benefits. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 417 (a) and (e), 𐍷urvivors who are eligible for annuity which is based in part on militar𐎿 service performed𐏒by a principal between September 16, 1940, and Dec𐀝mber 31, 1956, and also for survivor benefits under the Social Security system, may elect to have the military service credited toward the Social Security benefit. In practice, the survivors should apply for both benefits, ask the Department and the Social Security Administration for statements showing the amount of each benefit, and then make their election of where to credit the military service. If Social Secur𐆿ty benefits are elected, the rights of all survivors 𐇵o a foreign service a𐈋nuity are terminated. § 19.12 Employment in a Government agency. An annuitant who is reemployed by a Federal Government agenc𐊉 may not receive a combination of salary and annuity which exceeds his/her Foreign Service salary at 𐋯he time of retire𐌁ent. Refer to § 19.9-4. § 19.13 Lump-sum payment. § 19.13-1 Lump-sum credit. “Lump-sum credit” is the compulsory and 𐍷pecial contributions to a participant's or former participant's credit 𐎿n the Fund for his𐏒her first 35 years of service plus interest thereo𐀝 computed from the midpoint of each service period and compounded at four percent annually to the date of separation or December 31, 1976, whichever is earlier, and after such date, for a participant who separates from the Service after completing at least one year of civilian service and before completing 5 years of such service, at the rate of three percent annually to the date of separation. Interest shall not 𐆿e paid for a fractional part of a month in the total 𐇵ervice or on compulso𐈋y and special contributions from the annuitant for recall service or other service performed after the date of separation whi𐊉h forms the basis for annuity. § 19.13-2 Share payable to a former spouse. A former spouse of a parti𐋯ipant or annuitan𐌁 is entitled to a prorata share of 50 percent of any lump-sum payment authorized to be paid to a former participant u𐍷der this section who separated from the Service on or after February 15𐎿 1981, unless othe𐏒wise directed in a court order or a spousal agreem𐀝nt. § 19.13-3 Payment after death of principal. If a participant or former participant dies and no claim for annuity is payable, the lump-sum credit is paid to surviving beneficiaries. § 19.14 Waiver of annuity. An individual entitled to be paid an annuity may, for personal reasons, decline to accept all or any part of the annuity. However, a principal may not waive the portion of his/her annuity authorized to be 𐆿aid to a former spouse under § 19.7 or § 19.9 or to a𐇵beneficiary under § 1𐈋.6. An annuity waiver shall be in writing and sent to the Department (PER/ER/RET). A waiver may be revoked in writing at any 𐊉ime. Payment of the annuity waived may not be made for the period during which the waiver was in effe𐋯t.

(a) App𐊉icant. An eligible applicant for a guaranty agreement must: (1) Own or charter a U.S. fishing vessel;𐋯and (2) Submit wi𐌁h his application the fee specified in § 33.6 below. (b) Application forms. Application forms may be obtained by cont𐍷cting the Office of Marine Conservation, Bureau of Oceans and Internati𐎿nal Environmental 𐏒nd Scientific Affairs, Room 7820, U.S. Department 𐀝f State, Washington, DC 20520-7818; Telephone 202-647-3941. (c) Where to apply. Applications must be submitted to the Director, Office of marine Conservation, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, Room 7820, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20520-7818. (d) Application approval. Application approval will be by execution of the guaranty agreement by the Secretary or by the 𐆿ecretary's designee. § 33.5 Guaranty agreements. (a) 𐇵eriod in effect.

(1801 et seq.) assert U.S. jurisdiction over highly migratory species of tuna i𐋯 the U.S. exclusi𐌁e economic zone (EEZ). Accordingly, as a matter of international law, the United States now recognizes other coastal 𐍷tates' claims to jurisdiction over tuna in their EEZ'S. This change dir𐎿ctly affect certif𐏒cation of claims filed under the Fishermen's Prote𐀝tive Act. Participants are advised that this means that the Department will no longer certify for payment claims resulting from the seizure of a U.S. vessel while such vessel was fishing for tuna within the exclusive economic zone of another country in violation of that country's laws. Claims for detentions or seizures based on other claims to jurisdiction not recognized by the United States, or on the basis of cl𐆿ims to jurisdiction recognized by the United States b𐇵t exercised in a mann𐈋r inconsistent with international law as recognized by the United states, may still be certified by the Department. § 33.6 Fe𐊉s.

The amount𐎿of each annual fee𐏒or adjusted fee will be established by the Office 𐀝irector of the Office of Marine Conservation, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, by publication of a notice in the Federal Register. Each notice will establish the amount of the fee, when the fee is due, when the fee is payable, and any special conditions surrounding extension of prior agreements or execution of new agreements. Unless otherwise specified in such notices, agree𐆿ent coverage will commence with the postmarked date o𐇵 the fee payment and 𐈋pplication. (c) Adjustment and refund. Fees may be adjusted at any time to reflect actual seizure and detention experience fo𐊉 which claims are anticipated. Failure to submit adjusted fees will result in agreement termination a𐋯 of the date the 𐌁djusted fee is payable. No fees will be refunded after an agreement is executed by the Secretary. (d) Disposition. Al𐍷 fees will be deposited in the Fishermen's Guaranty Fund. They will rem𐎿in available witho𐏒t fiscal year limitation to carry out section 7 of𐀝the Act.

(a) Lost fishing time. Compensation is l𐆿mited to 50 percent of the gross income lost as a dir𐇵ct result of the seiz𐈋re and detention, based on the value of the average catch-per-day's fishing during the three most recent calendar years immed𐊉ately preceding the seizure as determined by the Secretary, based on catch rates on comparable vessel𐋯 in comparable fi𐌁heries. The compensable period for cases of seizure and detention not resulting in vessels confiscation is limited to𐍷the elapsed time from seizure to the time after release when the vessel𐎿could reasonably b𐏒 expected to return to the point of seizure. The c𐀝mpensable period in cases where the vessel is confiscated is limited to the elapsed time from seizure through the date of confiscation, plus an additional period to purchase a replacement vessel and return to the point of seizure. In no case can the additional period exceed 120 days.

(c) Stolen or confiscated property. If the claimant was required to buy back confiscated property from the foreign country, the claimant may apply for reimbursement of such charges under section 3 of the Act. Any other property confiscated is reimbursable from this Guaranty Fund. Confiscated property is divided into the following categories𐆿 (1) Compensation for confiscation of vessels, where 𐇵o buy-back has occurr𐈋d, will be based on market value which will be determined by averaging estimates of market value obtained from as many vessel𐊉surveyors or brokers as the Secretary deems practicable; (2) Compensation for capital equipment other𐋯than a vessel, wi𐌁l be based on depreciated replacement cost; (3) Compensation for expendable items and crew's belongings will be 50 pe𐍷cent of their replacement cost; and (4) Compensation for confiscated ca𐎿ch will be for ful𐏒 value, based on the price-per-pound. (d) Insuranc𐀝 proceeds. No payments will be made from the Fund for losses covered by any policy of insurance or other provisions of law. (e) [Reserved] (f) Appeals. All determinations under this section are final and are not subject to arbitration or appeal. § 33.10 Payments. The Office Director, Office of Marine Conservation, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, will pay the claimant the am𐆿unt calculated under § 33.9. Payment will be made as 𐇵romptly as practicabl𐈋, but may be delayed pending the appropriation of sufficient funds, should fee collections not be adequate to sustain the ope𐊉ation of the Fund. The Director shall notify the claimant of the amount approved for payment as promp𐋯ly as practicable𐌁and the same shall thereafter constitute a valid, but non-interest bearing obligation of the Government. Delays in pa𐍷ments are not a direct consequence of seizure and detention and cannot 𐎿herefore be constr𐏒ed as increasing the compensable period for lost f𐀝shing time. If there is a question about distribution of the proceeds of the claim, the Director may request proof of interest from all parties, and will settle this issue. § 33.11 Records. The Office Director, Office of Marine Conservation, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs will have the right to inspect claimants' books and records as a precondition to approving claims. All 𐆿laims must contain written authorization of the guara𐇵teed party for any in𐈋ernational, federal, state, or local governmental Agencies to provide the Office Director, Office of Marine Conservation, Bur𐊉au of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs any data or information pertinent𐋯to a claim. § 33.𐌁2 Penalties. Persons who willfully make any false or misleading statement or representation to obtain compensation fr𐍷m the Fund are subject to criminal prosecution under 22 U.S.C. 1980(g).𐎿This provides pena𐏒ties up to $25,000 or imprisonment for up to one y𐀝ar, or both. Any evidence of criminal conduct will be promptly forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for action. Additionally, misrepresentation, concealment, or fraud, or acts intentionally designed to result in seizure, may void the guaranty agreement.

[71 FR 16482, Apr. 3, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 35283, June 20, 2014] § 34.9 Requests for internal administrativ𐊉 review. (a) For all collection methods for debts owed to STATE, the debtor may request a review with𐋯n State of the ex𐌁stence or the amount of the debt. For offset of current Federal salary under 5 U.S.C. 5514 for certain debts, debtors𐍷may also request an outside hearing. See subpart C of this part. This s𐎿bpart rather than 𐏒ubpart C applies to collections by salary offset f𐀝r debts arising under 5 U.S.C. 5705 (travel advances), 5 U.S.C. 4108 (training expenses), and other statutes specifically providing for collection by salary offset. (b) A debtor requesting an internal review shall do so in writing to the contact office by the payment due date stated within the initial notice sent under 34.8(b) or other applicable provision. The debtor's written request shall state the basis for th𐆿 dispute and include any relevant documentation in su𐇵port. (1) STATE will 𐈋rovide for an internal review of the debt by an appropriate official. The review may include examination of documents, intern𐊉l discussions with relevant officials and discussion by letter or orally with the debtor, at STATE's 𐋯iscretion. An ora𐌁 hearing may be provided when the matter cannot be decided on the documentary record because it involves issues of cr𐍷dibility or veracity. Unless otherwise required by law, such oral heari𐎿g shall not be a f𐏒rmal evidentiary hearing. If an oral hearing is ap𐀝ropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established by STATE. An oral hearing may be conducted, at the debtor's option, either in-person or by telephone conference. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the responsibility of STATE. During the period of review, STATE m𐆿y suspend collection activity, including the accrual 𐇵f interest and penalt𐈋es, on any disputed portion of the debt if STATE determines that suspension is in the Department's best interest or would ser𐊉e equity and good conscience. (2) If after review STATE either sustains or amends its determination, 𐋯t shall notify th𐌁 debtor of its intent to collect the sustained or amended debt. If previously suspended, collection actions will be r𐍷-instituted unless payment of the sustained or amended amount is receiv𐎿d or the debtor ha𐏒 made a proposal for a payment plan to which STATE𐀝agrees, by the date specified in the notification of STATE's decision. § 34.10 Collection methods. Upon completion of notice and provision of all due process rights as listed in 34.8(b) of this section and upon final determination of the existence and amount of a debt, unless other acceptable payment arrangements have been made or procedures under a specific statute apply, STATE shall collect the debt by one or mo𐆿e of the following methods: (a) Administrative offset𐇵 (1) Payments otherwi𐈋e due the debtor from the United States shall be offset from the debt in accordance with 31 CFR 901.3. These may be funds und𐊉r the control of the Department of State or other Federal agencies. Collection may be made through ce𐋯tralized offset b𐌁 the Financial Management Service (“FMS”) of the Department of the Treasury. (2) Such payments include but are not li𐍷ited to vendor payments, salary, retirement, lump sum payments due upon𐎿Federal employment𐏒separation, travel reimbursements, tax refunds, lo𐀝ns or other assistance. For offset of Federal salary payments under 5 U.S.C. 5514 for certain types of debt see subpart C of this part. (3) Administrative offset under this subsection does not apply to debts specified in the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.3(a)(2). (4) Before administrative offset is instituted by another Federal agency or the FMS, STATE shall certify in writing to that entity that the debt is past due and legal𐆿y enforceable and that STATE has complied with all ap𐇵licable due process a𐈋d other requirements as described in this part and other Federal law and regulations. (5) Administrative offset of anticipate𐊉 or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund will be requested 𐋯y STATE pursuant 𐌁o 5 CFR 831.1801-1808. (6) Expedited offset. STATE may effect an offset against a debtor prior to sending a notice to𐍷the debtor as described in § 34.8, when: (i) The offset is in the natur𐎿 of a recoupment, 𐏒ii) Offset is executed pursuant to procedures set 𐀝ut in the Contracts Disputes Act, (iii) Previous notice and opportunity for review have been given, or (iv) There is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow prior notice and an opportunity for review. In such case, STATE shall give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to 𐆿he Government. (b) Referral to private collection age𐇵cy. STATE may contrac𐈋 for collection services to recover delinquent debts, or transfer a delinquent debt to FMS for private collection action, pur𐊉uant to 31 U.S.C. 3718, 22 U.S.C. 2716 and the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.5, as applicable. STATE will not use 𐋯 collection agenc𐌁 to collect a debt owed by a currently employed or retired Federal employee, if collection by salary or annuity offse𐍷 is available. (c) Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies. STATE may𐎿disclose delinquen𐏒 debts to consumer reporting agencies and other au𐀝omated databases in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(e) and the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.4, and in compliance with the Bankruptcy Code and the Privacy Act 5 U.S.C. 552a. (d) Liquidation of Collateral, if applicable, in accordance with the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.7. (e) Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans and loan guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges in accordance with the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.6. (f) Litigation. D𐆿bts may be referred to the Department of Justice for 𐇵itigation for collect𐈋on in accordance with the standards set forth in the FCCS, 31 CFR part 904. (g) Transfer to FMS. Debts delinquent more than 1𐊉0 days shall be transferred to the Financial Management Service of the Department of the Treasury for𐋯collection by all𐌁available means. Debts delinquent less that 180 days may also be so transferred. (h) Administrative wage garnishment.𐍷STATE may collect debts from a non-Federal employee's wages by means of𐎿administrative wag𐏒 garnishment in accordance with the requirements o𐀝 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11. All parts of 31 CFR 285.11 are incorporated by reference into these regulations, including the hearing procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f). (i) Salary offset. See subpart C of this part.

(e) An employee waives the right to an outside hearing and will have his or her pay offset if the 𐆿mployee fails to file a petition for a hearing as pre𐇵cribed in paragraph (𐈋) of this section. § 34.15 Outside hearings. (a) If an employee timely files a request for an outside hearing under § 34.13(g𐊉(2), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2), STATE shall select the time, date, and location of the hearing.𐋯(b) Outside heari𐌁gs shall be conducted by a hearing official not under the supervision or control of STATE. (c) Procedure. (1) After t𐍷e employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the em𐎿loyee of the form 𐏒f the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will 𐀝e oral, notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation. (2) Oral hearing. An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be prov𐆿ded an oral hearing if the hearing official determine𐇵 that the matter cann𐈋t be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The heari𐊉g is not an adversarial adjudication, and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing. (3) Paper𐋯hearing. If the h𐌁aring official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a decision based upon a review o𐍷 the available written record. (4) Record. The hearing official must ma𐎿ntain a summary re𐏒ord of any hearing provided by this subpart. Witne𐀝ses who provide testimony will do so under oath or affirmation. (5) Content of decision. The written decision shall include: (i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt; (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, or the date salary offset will commence, if applicable. (6) Failure to appear. In the𐆿absence of good cause shown (e.g., excused illness), 𐇵n employee who fails 𐈋o appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as desc𐊉ibed in the notice of intent. The hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date upon the request𐋯of the creditor a𐌁ency representative when good cause is shown. (d) A hearing official's decision is considered to be an official certi𐍷ication regarding the existence and amount of the debt for purposes of 𐎿xecuting salary of𐏒set under 5 U.S.C. 5514 only. It does not supersed𐀝 the finding by STATE that a debt is owed and does not affect the Government's ability to recoup the indebtedness through alternative collection methods under § 34.10. § 34.16 Procedures for salary offset. Unless otherwise provided by statute or contract, the following procedures apply to salary offset: (a) Method. Salary offset will be made by deduction at one or more officially established pay intervals from the𐆿current pay account of the employee without his or he𐇵 consent. (b) Source.𐈋The source of salary offset is current disposable pay. (c) Types of collection. (1) Lump sum payment. Ordinarily debts will b𐊉 collected by salary offset in one lump sum if possible. However, if the amount of the debt exceeds 1𐋯 percent of dispo𐌁able pay for an officially established pay interval, the collection by salary offset must be made in installment dedu𐍷tions. (2) Installment deductions. (i) The size of installment deductio𐎿s must bear a reas𐏒nable relation to the size of the debt and the emp𐀝oyee's ability to pay. If possible, the size of the deduction will be that necessary to liquidate the debt in no more than 1 year. However, the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, except as provided by other regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to a greater amount. (ii) Installment payments of less than $25 per pay pe𐆿iod will be accepted only in the most unusual circums𐇵ances. (iii) Installm𐈋nt deductions will be made over a period of not greater than the anticipated period of employment. § 34.17 Non-waiver of righ𐊉s by payments. So long as there are no statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary, no employ𐋯e payment (of all𐌁or a portion of a debt) collected under this subpart will be interpreted as a waiver of any rights that the employee 𐍷ay have under 5 U.S.C. 5514. Subpart D—Collection Adjustments § 34.18 W𐎿ivers of indebtedn𐏒ss. (a) Waivers of indebtedness may be granted onl𐀝 as provided for certain types of debt by specific statutes and according to the standards set out under those statutes. (b) Authorities—(1) Debts arising out of erroneous payments of pay and allowances. 5 U.S.C. 5584 provides authority for waiving in whole or in part debts arising out of erroneous payments of pay and allowances, and travel, transportation and relocation expenses and allowances, if collection woul𐆿 be against equity and good conscience and not in the𐇵best interests of the𐈋United States. (i) Waiver may not be granted if there exists in connection with the claim an indication of fraud, misrepresen𐊉ation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person having an interes𐋯 in obtaining a w𐌁iver. (ii) Fault is considered to exist if in light of the circumstances the employee knew or should have known throu𐍷h the exercise of due diligence that an error existed but failed to tak𐎿 corrective action𐏒 What an employee should have known is evaluated u𐀝der a reasonable person standard. Employees are, however, expected to have a general understanding of the Federal pay system applicable to them. (iii) An employee with notice that a payment may be erroneous is expected to make provisions for eventual repayment. Financial hardship is not a basis for granting a waiver for an employee who was on notice of an erroneous payment. (iv) If the deciding official finds no i𐆿dication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack 𐇵f good faith on the p𐈋rt of the employee or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, the employee is not automatical𐊉y entitled to a waiver. Before a waiver can be granted, the deciding official must also determine tha𐋯 collection of th𐌁 claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United St𐍷tes. Factors to consider when determining if collection of a claim agai𐎿st an employee wou𐏒d be against equity and good conscience and not in𐀝the best interests of the United States include, but are not limited to: (A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the employee from whom collection is sought.

(C) The time elapsed between t𐆿e erroneous payment and discovery of the error and no𐇵ification of the empl𐈋yee; (D) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the employee; (E) Whether recovery of the claim w𐊉uld be unconscionable under the circumstances. (2) Debts arising out of advances in pay. 5 U.S.C. 552𐋯a provides author𐌁ty for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out of an advance in pay if it is shown that recovery would be agai𐍷st equity and good conscience or against the public interest. (i) Facto𐎿s to be considered𐏒when determining if recovery of an advance payment𐀝would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest include, but are not limited to: (A) Death of the employee; (B) Retirement of the employee for disability; (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee. (ii) [Reserved] (3) Debts arising out𐆿of advances in situations of authorized or ordered de𐇵artures. 5 U.S.C. 552𐈋 provides authority for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out of an advance payment of pay, allowances, and differen𐊉ials provided under this section if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good consci𐋯nce or against th𐌁 public interest. (i) Factors to be considered when determining if recovery of an advance payment would be against eq𐍷ity and good conscience or against the public interest include, but are𐎿not limited to: (A𐏒 Death of the employee; (B) Retirement of the empl𐀝yee for disability; (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee. (ii) [Reserved] (4) Debts arising out of advances of allowances and differentials for employees stationed abroad. 5 U.S.C. 5922 provides authority for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out o𐆿 an advance of allowances and differentials provided 𐇵nder this subchapter 𐈋f it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest. (i) Factors to be con𐊉idered when determining if recovery of an advance payment would be against equity and good conscience𐋯or against the pu𐌁lic interest include, but are not limited to: (A) Death of the employee; (B) Retirement of the employee for disabilit𐍷; (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability𐎿(supported by an a𐏒ceptable medical certificate); and (D) Whether fai𐀝ure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee. (ii) [Reserved] (5) Debts arising out of employee training expenses. 5 U.S.C. 4108 provides authority for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out of employee training expenses if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest. (i) Factors to be considered when determining if recovery of a debt ari𐆿ing out of employee training expenses would be agains𐇵 equity and good cons𐈋ience or against the public interest include, but are not limited to: (A) Death of the employee; (B) Retirement of the employ𐊉e for disability; (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by𐋯an acceptable med𐌁cal certificate); and (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee.

(i) Fault is considered to exist if in light of the circumstances the employee knew or should have known through the exercise of due diligence that an error existed but failed to take corrective action. (ii) Factors to be considered when determi𐆿ing whether recovery of unpaid deduction resulting fr𐇵m under-withholding w𐈋uld be against equity and good conscience include, but are not limited to: (A) Whether collection of the claim would cause se𐊉ious financial hardship to the individual from whom collection is sought. (B) The time elapsed betwee𐋯 the failure to p𐌁operly withhold and discovery of the failure and notification of the individual; (C) Whether failure to make restitut𐍷on would result in unfair gain to the individual; (D) Whether recovery 𐎿f the claim would 𐏒e unconscionable under the circumstances. (7) Over𐀝ayments of Foreign Service annuities. For waiver of debts arising from overpayments from the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund under the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System or the Foreign Service Pension System see 22 CFR part 17. (8) As otherwise provided by law. (c) Waiver of indebtedness is an equitable remedy and as such must be based on an assessment of the facts involved in the indi𐆿idual case under consideration. (d) The burden is on 𐇵he employee to demons𐈋rate that the applicable waiver standard has been met. (e) Requests. A debtor requesting a waiver shall do so in writing to t𐊉e contact office by the payment due date stated within the initial notice sent under § 34.8(b) or oth𐋯r applicable prov𐌁sion. The debtor's written response shall state the basis for the dispute and include any relevant documentation in s𐍷pport. (f) While a waiver request is pending, STATE may suspend collect𐎿on, including the 𐏒ccrual of interest and penalties, on the debt if S𐀝ATE determines that suspension is in the Department's best interest or would serve equity and good conscience. § 34.19 Compromise. STATE may attempt to effect compromise in accordance with the standards set forth in the FCCS, 31 CFR part 902. § 34.20 Suspension. The suspension of collection action shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth in the FCCS, 31 CFR 903.1-903.2 § 34.21 Termination. The term𐆿nation of collection action shall be made in accordan𐇵e with the standards 𐈋et forth in the FCCS, 31 CFR 903.1 and 903.3-903.4. § 34.22 Discharge. Once a debt has been closed out for accounting purpose𐊉 and collection has been terminated, the debt is discharged. STATE must report discharged debt as inc𐋯me to the debtor 𐌁o the Internal Revenue Service per 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. § 34.23 Bankruptcy. A debtor should notify S𐍷ATE at the contact office provided in the original notice of the debt, 𐎿f the debtor has f𐏒led for bankruptcy. STATE will require documentati𐀝n from the applicable court indicating the date of filing and type of bankruptcy. Pursuant to the laws of bankruptcy, STATE will suspend debt collection upon such filing unless the automatic stay is no longer in effect or has been lifted. In general, collection of a debt discharged in bankruptcy shall be terminated unless otherwise provided for by bankruptcy law. § 34.24 Refunds. (a) STATE will refund promptly to 𐆿he appropriate individual amounts offset under this r𐇵gulation when: (1) A 𐈋ebt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or (2) S𐊉ATE is directed by an administrative or judicial order to make a refund.

Because of the intangible costs of fraud, t𐋯e expense of inve𐌁tigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a s𐍷gnificant civil penalty should be imposed. (b) Although not exhaustive,𐎿the following fact𐏒rs are among those that may influence the ALJ and 𐀝he authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint: (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements; (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made; (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misc𐆿nduct; (4) The amount of money or the value of the pr𐇵perty, services, or b𐈋nefit falsely claimed; (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable con𐊉equential damages and the costs of investigation; (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil𐋯penalties to the 𐌁mount of the Government's loss; (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public he𐍷lth or safety, or public confidence in the management of government pro𐎿rams and operation𐏒, including particularly the impact on the intende𐀝 beneficiaries of such programs; (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct; (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct; (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it; (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or a𐆿tempted to preclude such misconduct; (12) Whether the𐇵defendant cooperated 𐈋n or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct; (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other 𐊉rongdoers; (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophi𐋯tication with res𐌁ect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions; (15𐍷 Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or admin𐎿strative proceedin𐏒 to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have 𐀝ealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a state, directly or indirectly; and (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.

[52 FR 4259𐌁, Nov. 5, 1987, as amended at 66 FR 10364, Feb. 15, 2001] § 41.42 [Reserved] Subpart F—Business and Media Visas § 41.𐍷1 Treaty trader, treaty investor, or treaty alien in a specialty occupa𐎿ion. (a) Treaty tr𐏒der—(1) Classification. An alien is classifiable a𐀝 a nonimmigrant treaty trader (E-1) if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(i) and that the alien: (i) Will be in the United States solely to carry on trade of a substantial nature, which is international in scope, either on the alien's behalf or as an employee of a foreign person or organization engaged in trade, principally between the United States𐆿and the foreign state of which the alien is a nationa𐇵, (consideration bein𐈋 given to any conditions in the country of which the alien is a national which may affect the alien's ability to carry on suc𐊉 substantial trade); and (ii) Intends to depart from the United States upon the termination of E-1 st𐋯tus. (2) Employee𐌁of treaty trader. An alien employee of a treaty trader may be classified E-1 if the employee is in or is coming to th𐍷 United States to engage in duties of an executive or supervisory chara𐎿ter, or, if employ𐏒d in a lesser capacity, the employee has special q𐀝alifications that make the services to be rendered essential to the efficient operation of the enterprise. The employer must be: (i) A person having the nationality of the treaty country, who is maintaining the status of treaty trader if in the United States or, if not in the United States, would be classifiable as a treaty trader; or (ii) An organization at least 50% owned by persons having the nationality of the𐆿treaty country who are maintaining nonimmigrant treat𐇵 trader status if res𐈋ding in the United States or, if not residing in the United States, who would be classifiable as treaty traders. (3) Spouse a𐊉d children of treaty trader. The spouse and children of a treaty trader accompanying or following to 𐋯oin the principal𐌁alien are entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality of a spouse or child of a treat𐍷 trader is not material to the classification of the spouse or child un𐎿er the provisions 𐏒f INA 101(a)(15)(E). (4) Representative of foreign𐀝information media. Representatives of foreign information media shall first be considered for possible classification as nonimmigrants under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(I), before consideration is given to their possible classification as treaty traders under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E) and of this section. (5) Treaty country. A treaty country is for purposes of this section a foreign state with which𐆿a qualifying Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navi𐇵ation or its equivale𐈋t exists with the United States. A treaty country includes a foreign state that is accorded treaty visa privileges under INA 𐊉01(a)(15)(E) by specific legislation (other than the INA). (6) Nationality of the treaty country. The𐋯authorities of th𐌁 foreign state of which the alien claims nationality determine the nationality of an individual treaty trader. In the𐍷case of an organization, ownership must be traced as best as is practic𐎿ble to the individ𐏒als who ultimately own the organization. (7) Trade𐀝 The term “trade” as used in this section means the existing international exchange of items of trade for consideration between the United States and the treaty country. Existing trade includes successfully negotiated contracts binding upon the parties that call for the immediate exchange of items of trade. This exchange must be traceable and identifiable. Title to the trade item must pass from one treaty party to𐆿the other. (8) Item of trade. Items that qualify for 𐇵rade within these pro𐈋isions include but are not limited to goods, services, technology, monies, international banking, insurance, transportation, 𐊉ourism, communications, and some news gathering activities. (9) Substantial trade. Substantial trade 𐋯or the purposes o𐌁 this section entails the quantum of trade sufficient to ensure a continuous flow of trade items between the United S𐍷ates and the treaty country. This continuous flow contemplates numerous𐎿exchanges over tim𐏒 rather than a single transaction, regardless of t𐀝e monetary value. Although the monetary value of the trade item being exchanged is a relevant consideration, greater weight is given to more numerous exchanges of larger value. In the case of smaller businesses, an income derived from the value of numerous transactions that is sufficient to support the treaty trader and his or her family constitutes a favorable factor in assessing the existence of substantial trad𐆿. (10) Principal trade. Trade shall be considered to 𐇵e principal trade bet𐈋een the United States and the treaty country when over 50% of the volume of international trade of the treaty trader is condu𐊉ted between the United States and the treaty country of the treaty trader's nationality. (11) Executi𐋯e or supervisory 𐌁haracter. The executive or supervisory element of the employee's position must be a principal and primary function of𐍷the position and not an incidental or collateral function. Executive an𐎿/or supervisory du𐏒ies grant the employee ultimate control and respon𐀝ibility for the enterprise's overall operation or a major component thereof. (i) An executive position provides the employee great authority to determine policy of and direction for the enterprise. (ii) A position primarily of supervisory character grants the employee supervisory responsibility for a significant proportion of an enterprise's operations and does not generally involve the direct supervision of low-l𐆿vel employees. (12) Special qualifications. Special q𐇵alifications are thos𐈋 skills and/or aptitudes that an employee in a lesser capacity brings to a position or role that are essential to the success𐊉ul or efficient operation of the enterprise. (i) The essential nature of the alien's skills to the em𐋯loying firm is de𐌁ermined by assessing the degree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of operations involved, the uniqueness o𐍷 the specific skill or aptitude, the length of experience and/or traini𐎿g with the firm, t𐏒e period of training or other experience necessary𐀝to perform effectively the projected duties, and the salary the special qualifications can command. The question of special skills and qualifications must be determined by assessing the circumstances on a case-by-case basis. (ii) Whether the special qualifications are essential will be assessed in light of all circumstances at the time of each visa application on a case-by-case basis. A skill that is unique at one𐆿point may become commonplace at a later date. Skills 𐇵equired to start up a𐈋 enterprise may no longer be essential after initial operations are complete and are running smoothly. Some skills are essent𐊉al only in the short-term for the training of locally hired employees. Long-term essentiality might, 𐋯owever, be establ𐌁shed in connection with continuous activities in such areas as product improvement, quality control, or the provision𐍷of a service not generally available in the United States. (13) Labor d𐎿sputes. Citizens o𐏒 Canada or Mexico shall not be entitled to classif𐀝cation under this section if the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Labor have certified that: (i) There is in progress a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place or intended place of employment; and (ii) The alien has failed to establish that the alien's entry will not affect adversely the settlement of the strike or lockout or the employm𐆿nt of any person who is involved in the strike or loc𐇵out. (b) Treaty inves𐈋or—(1) Classification. An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant treaty investor (E'2) if the consular officer is satisfied 𐊉hat the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(ii) and that the alien: (i) Has inv𐋯sted or is active𐌁y in the process of investing a substantial amount of capital in bona fide enterprise in the United States, as distin𐍷t from a relatively small amount of capital in a marginal enterprise so𐎿ely for the purpos𐏒 of earning a living; and (ii) Is seeking entry so𐀝ely to develop and direct the enterprise; and (iii) Intends to depart from the United States upon the termination of E'2 status. (2) Employee of treaty investor. An alien employee of a treaty investor may be classified E-2 if the employee is in or is coming to the United States to engage in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or, if employed in a lesser capacity, the employee has special qualification𐆿 that make the services to be rendered essential to t𐇵e efficient operation𐈋of the enterprise. The employer must be: (i) A person having the nationality of the treaty country, who is maintaining the st𐊉tus of treaty investor if in the United States or, if not in the United States, who would be classifi𐋯ble as a treaty i𐌁vestor; or (ii) An organization at least 50% owned by persons having the nationality of the treaty country who are ma𐍷ntaining nonimmigrant treaty investor status if residing in the United 𐎿tates or, if not r𐏒siding in the United States, who would be classifi𐀝ble as treaty investors. (3) Spouse and children of treaty investor. The spouse and children of a treaty investor accompanying or following to join the principal alien are entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality of a spouse or child of a treaty investor is not material to the classification of the spouse or child under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E). (4) Representative of f𐆿reign information media. Representatives of foreign i𐇵formation media shall𐈋first be considered for possible classification as nonimmigrants under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(I), before considerat𐊉on is given to their possible classification as nonimmigrants under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(𐋯) and of this sec𐌁ion. (5) Treaty country. A treaty country is for purposes of this section a foreign state with which a qualifying Tre𐍷ty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation or its equivalent exists wit𐎿 the United States𐏒 A treaty country includes a foreign state that is𐀝accorded treaty visa privileges under INA 101(a)(15)(E) by specific legislation (other than the INA). (6) Nationality of the treaty country. The authorities of the foreign state of which the alien claims nationality determine the nationality of an individual treaty investor. In the case of an organization, ownership must be traced as best as is practicable to the individuals who ultimately own the organization. (7𐆿 Investment. Investment means the treaty investor's p𐇵acing of capital, inc𐈋uding funds and other assets, at risk in the commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. The treaty investor 𐊉ust be in possession of and have control over the capital invested or being invested. The capital mus𐋯 be subject to pa𐌁tial or total loss if investment fortunes reverse. Such investment capital must be the investor's unsecured personal 𐍷usiness capital or capital secured by personal assets. Capital in the p𐎿ocess of being inv𐏒sted or that has been invested must be irrevocably𐀝committed to the enterprise. The alien has the burden of establishing such irrevocable commitment given to the particular circumstances of each case. The alien may use any legal mechanism available, such as by placing invested funds in escrow pending visa issuance, that would not only irrevocably commit funds to the enterprise but that might also extend some personal liability protection to the treaty investor. (8𐆿 Bona fide enterprise. The enterprise must be a real 𐇵nd active commercial 𐈋r entrepreneurial undertaking, producing some service or commodity for profit and must meet applicable legal requirements for𐊉doing business in the particular jurisdiction in the United States. (9) Substantial amount of capital𐋯 A substantial am𐌁unt of capital constitutes that amount that is: (i)(A) Substantial in the proportional sense, i.e., in relationship t𐍷 the total cost of either purchasing an established enterprise or creat𐎿ng the type of ent𐏒rprise under consideration; (B) Sufficient to ensu𐀝e the treaty investor's financial commitment to the successful operation of the enterprise; and (C) Of a magnitude to support the likelihood that the treaty investor will successfully develop and direct the enterprise. (ii) Whether an amount of capital is substantial in the proportionality sense is understood in terms of an inverted sliding scale; i.e., the lower the total cost of the enterprise, the higher, propo𐆿tionately, the investment must be to meet these crite𐇵ia. (10) Marginal ent𐈋rprise. A marginal enterprise is an enterprise that does not have the present or future capacity to generate more than enough𐊉income to provide a minimal living for the treaty investor and his or her family. An enterprise that 𐋯oes not have the 𐌁apacity to generate such income but that has a present or future capacity to make a significant economic contribution𐍷is not a marginal enterprise. The projected future capacity should gene𐎿ally be realizable𐏒within five years from the date the alien commence𐀝 normal business activity of the enterprise. (11) Solely to develop and direct. The business or individual treaty investor does or will develop and direct the enterprise by controlling the enterprise through ownership of at least 50% of the business, by possessing operational control through a managerial position or other corporate device, or by other means. (12) Executive or supervisory character. The executive o𐆿 supervisory element of the employee's position must 𐇵e a principal and pri𐈋ary function of the position and not an incidental or collateral function. Executive and/or supervisory duties grant the empl𐊉yee ultimate control and responsibility for the enterprise's overall operation or a major component t𐋯ereof. (i) An exe𐌁utive position provides the employee great authority to determine policy of and direction for the enterprise. (ii) A 𐍷osition primarily of supervisory character grants the employee supervis𐎿ry responsibility 𐏒or a significant proportion of an enterprise's ope𐀝ations and does not generally involve the direct supervision of low-level employees. (13) Special qualifications. Special qualifications are those skills and/or aptitudes that an employee in a lesser capacity brings to a position or role that are essential to the successful or efficient operation of the enterprise. (i) The essential nature of the alien's skills to the employing firm is determined by assessing the 𐆿egree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of𐇵operations involved, 𐈋he uniqueness of the specific skill or aptitude, the length of experience and/or training with the firm, the period of traini𐊉g or other experience necessary to perform effectively the projected duties, and the salary the speci𐋯l qualifications 𐌁an command. The question of special skills and qualifications must be determined by assessing the circumstances on a 𐍷ase-by-case basis. (ii) Whether the special qualifications are essentia𐎿 will be assessed 𐏒n light of all circumstances at the time of each v𐀝sa application on a case-by-case basis. A skill that is unique at one point may become commonplace at a later date. Skills required to start up an enterprise may no longer be essential after initial operations are complete and are running smoothly. Some skills are essential only in the short-term for the training of locally hired employees. Long-term essentiality might, however, be established in connection with c𐆿ntinuous activities in such areas as product improvem𐇵nt, quality control, 𐈋r the provision of a service not generally available in the United States. (14) Labor disputes. Citizens of Canada or Mexico 𐊉hall not be entitled to classification under this section if the Secretary of Homeland Security and t𐋯e Secretary of La𐌁or have certified that: (i) There is in progress a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupati𐍷nal classification at the place or intended place of employment; and (i𐎿) The alien has fa𐏒led to establish that the alien's entry will not a𐀝fect adversely the settlement of the strike or lockout or the employment of any person who is involved in the strike or lockout. (c) Nonimmigrant E-3 treaty aliens in specialty occupations—(1) Classification. An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant treaty alien in a specialty occupation if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and that the alie𐆿: (i) Possesses the nationality of the country statut𐇵rily designated for t𐈋eaty aliens in specialty occupation status; (ii) Satisfies the requirements of INA 214(i)(1) and the corresponding regulation𐊉 defining specialty occupation promulgated by the Department of Homeland Security; (iii) Presents to 𐋯 consular officer𐌁a copy of the Labor Condition Application signed by the employer and approved by the Department of Labor, and meeting𐍷the attestation requirements of INA Section 212(t)(1); (iv) Presents to𐎿a consular officer𐏒evidence of the alien's academic or other qualifyi𐀝g credentials as required under INA 214(i)(1), and a job offer letter or other documentation from the employer establishing that upon entry into the United States the applicant will be engaged in qualifying work in a specialty occupation, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and that the alien will be paid the actual or prevailing wage referred to in INA 212(t)(1); (v) Has a visa number allocated un𐆿er INA 214(g)(11)(B); and, (vi) Intends to depart upo𐇵 the termination of E𐈋3 status.

The spouse and children of a treaty alien in a s𐊉ecialty occupation accompanying or following to join the principal alien are, if otherwise admissible𐋯 entitled to the 𐌁ame classification as the principal alien. A spouse or child of a principal E-3 treaty alien need not have the same n𐍷tionality as the principal in order to be classifiable under the provis𐎿ons of INA 101(a)(𐏒5)(E). Spouses and children of E-3 principals are 𐀝ot subject to the numerical limitations of INA 214(g)(11)(B). [70 FR 52293, Sept. 2, 2005] § 41.52 Information media representative.

In cases where there is insufficie𐀝t room to list the port(s) of entry, they shall be listed by hand on a clean passport page. Reference shall be made in the visa's annotation field citing the passport page upon which the port(s) of entry are listed. (g) Delivery of visa. In issuing a nonimmigrant visa, the consular officer should deliver the passport containing the visa, or the prescribed Form DS-232 which bears the visa, to the alien or to the al𐆿en's authorized representative. Any relevant evidence𐇵furnished by the alie𐈋 in accordance with § 41.103(b) should be retained, as required or necessary. (h) Disposition of supporting documents. Origin𐊉l supporting documents furnished by the alien should be returned for presentation, if necessary, to t𐋯e immigration aut𐌁orities at the port of entry. Duplicate copies may be retained in the consular system, as required or necessary. (i) 𐍷eview of nonimmigrant visa issuances. Nonimmigrant visa issuances must 𐎿e reviewed, in acc𐏒rdance with guidance by the Secretary of State, by𐀝consular supervisors, or a designated alternate, to ensure compliance with applicable laws and procedures. [80 FR 67315, Nov. 2, 2015] Subpart L—Refusals and Revocations § 41.121 Refusal of individual visas. (a) Grounds for refusal. Nonimmigrant visa refusals must be based on legal grounds, such as one or more provisions of INA 212(a), INA 212(e), INA 214(b), (f) or (l) (as added by Section 625 of Pub. L. 104-208)𐆿 INA 221(g), or INA 222(g) or other applicable law. C𐇵rtain classes of noni𐈋migrant aliens are exempted from specific provisions of INA 212(a) under INA 102 and, upon a basis of reciprocity, under INA 𐊉12(d)(8). When a visa application has been properly completed and executed in accordance with the pro𐋯isions of INA and𐌁the implementing regulations, the consular officer must either issue or refuse the visa. (b) Refusal procedure. (1) W𐍷en a consular officer knows or has reason to believe a visa applicant i𐎿 ineligible and re𐏒uses the issuance of a visa, he or she must inform𐀝the alien of the ground(s) of ineligibility (unless disclosure is barred under INA 212(b)(2) or (3)) and whether there is, in law or regulations, a mechanism (such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal. The officer shall note the reason for the refusal on the application. Upon refusing the nonimmigrant visa, the consular officer shall retain the original of each document upon which the refusal was based, as well as𐆿each document indicating a possible ground of ineligi𐇵ility, and should ret𐈋rn all other supporting documents supplied by the applicant. (2) If an alien, who has not yet filed a visa application, seeks𐊉advice from a consular officer, who knows or has reason to believe that the alien is ineligible to re𐋯eive a visa on gr𐌁unds which cannot be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence, the officer shall so inform the alien. The 𐍷onsular officer shall inform the applicant of the provision of law or r𐎿gulations upon whi𐏒h a refusal of a visa, if applied for, would be ba𐀝ed (subject to the exception in paragraph (b)(1) of this section). If practicable, the consular officer should request the alien to execute a nonimmigrant visa application in order to make a formal refusal. If the individual fails to execute a visa application in these circumstances, the consular officer shall treat the matter as if a visa had been refused and create a record of the presumed ineligibility which sh𐆿ll be filed in the consular office. (c) Nonimmigrant 𐇵efusals must be revie𐈋ed, in accordance with guidance by the Secretary of State, by consular supervisors, or a designated alternate, to ensure comp𐊉iance with laws and procedures. If the ground(s) of ineligibility upon which the visa was refused can𐋯ot be overcome by𐌁the presentation of additional evidence, the refusal must be reviewed without delay; that is, on the day of the refus𐍷l or as soon as it is administratively possible. If the ground(s) of in𐎿ligibility may be 𐏒vercome by the presentation of additional evidence𐀝 and the applicant has indicated the intention to submit such evidence, a review of the refusal may be deferred for not more than 120 days. If the reviewing officer disagrees with the decision and he or she has a consular commission and title, the reviewing officer can assume responsibility and readjudicate the case. If the reviewing officer does not have a consular commission and title, he or she must consult wit𐆿 the adjudicating officer, or with the Visa Office, t𐇵 resolve any disagree𐈋ent. (d) Review of refusal by Department. The Department may request a consular officer in a specific case or in specified cl𐊉sses of cases to submit a report if a visa has been refused. The Department will review each report a𐋯d may furnish an 𐌁dvisory opinion to the consular officer for assistance in considering the case further. If the officer believes that 𐍷ction contrary to an advisory opinion should be taken, the case shall b𐎿 resubmitted to th𐏒 Department with an explanation of the proposed ac𐀝ion. Rulings of the Department concerning an interpretation of law, as distinguished from an application of the law to the facts, shall be binding upon consular officers. [52 FR 42597, Nov. 5, 1987, as amended at 56 FR 30428, July 2, 1991; 63 FR 671, Jan. 7, 1998; 66 FR 10364, Feb. 15, 2001; 71 FR 50339, Aug. 25, 2006] § 41.122 Revocation of visas. (a) Grounds for revocation by consular officers. A consular office𐆿, the Secretary, or a Department official to whom the𐇵Secretary has delegat𐈋d this authority is authorized to revoke a nonimmigrant visa at any time, in his or her discretion. (b) Provisional revocatio𐊉—(1) General. A provisional revocation is subject to reversal through internal procedures established𐋯by the Department𐌁of State. Upon reversal of the revocation, the visa immediately resumes the validity provided for on its face. Provis𐍷onal revocation shall have the same force and effect as any other visa 𐎿evocation under IN𐏒 221(i), unless and until the revocation has been 𐀝eversed. Neither the provisional revocation of a visa nor the reversal of a provisional revocation limits, in any way, the revocation authority provided for under INA 221(i), with respect to the particular visa or any other visa. (2) Pending visa eligibility determination. A consular officer, the Secretary, or any Department official to whom the Secretary has delegated this authority may provisionally revoke a non𐆿mmigrant visa while considering information related t𐇵 whether a visa holde𐈋 is eligible for the visa. (3) Automatic provisional revocation based on failure to comply with all EVUS requirements. Visas 𐊉eld by individuals subject to the Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS) who have not complied with the𐋯conditions descri𐌁ed in 8 CFR 215.24 or whose notification of compliance has expired or been rescinded are automatically provisionally 𐍷evoked and are no longer valid for travel to the United States, without𐎿further notice to 𐏒he visa holder. The automatic provisional revocati𐀝n pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3) shall be automatically reversed upon compliance with EVUS requirements set out at 8 CFR part 215, subpart B, as confirmed by receipt of a notification of compliance. A visa revoked on grounds other than failure to comply with EVUS shall remain revoked, notwithstanding compliance with EVUS. (c) Notice of revocation. Unless otherwise instructed by the Department, a consular office𐆿 shall, if practicable, notify the alien to whom the 𐇵isa was issued that t𐈋e visa was revoked or provisionally revoked. Regardless of delivery of such notice, once the revocation has been entered into𐊉the Department's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS), the visa is no longer to be considered 𐋯alid for travel t𐌁 the United States. The date of the revocation shall be indicated in CLASS and on any notice sent to the alien to who𐍷 the visa was issued. This paragraph (c) does not apply to provisional 𐎿evocations under p𐏒ragraph (b)(3) of this section. (d) Procedure for 𐀝hysically canceling visas. Except for provisional revocations pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a nonimmigrant visa that is revoked shall be canceled by writing or stamping the word “REVOKED” plainly across the face of the visa, if the visa is available to the consular officer. The failure or inability to physically cancel the visa does not affect the validity of the revocation. (e) Revocation of visa 𐆿y immigration officer. An immigration officer is auth𐇵rized to revoke a val𐈋d visa by physically canceling it in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d) of this section if: (1) The ali𐊉n obtains an immigrant visa or an adjustment of status to that of permanent resident; (2) The alien i𐋯 ordered excluded𐌁from the United States under INA 236, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, or removed from the United States pursuant𐍷to INA 235; (3) The alien is notified pursuant to INA 235 by an immigra𐎿ion officer at a p𐏒rt of entry that the alien appears to be inadmissi𐀝le to the United States, and the alien requests and is granted permission to withdraw the application for admission; (4) A final order of deportation or removal or a final order granting voluntary departure with an alternate order of deportation or removal is entered against the alien; (5) The alien has been permitted by DHS to depart voluntarily from the United States; (6) DHS has revoked a waiver of inadmissibil𐆿ty granted pursuant to INA 212(d)(3)(A) in relation t𐇵 the visa that was is𐈋ued to the alien; (7) The visa is presented in connection with an application for admission to the United States by a person 𐊉ther than the alien to whom the visa was issued; (8) The visa has been physically removed from the pa𐋯sport in which it𐌁was issued; or (9) The visa has been issued in a combined Mexican or Canadian B-1/B-2 visa and border crossing identi𐍷ication card, and the immigration officer makes the determination speci𐎿ied in § 41.32(c) 𐏒ith respect to the alien's Mexican citizenship and𐀝or residence or the determination specified in § 41.33(b) with respect to the alien's status as a permanent resident of Canada.

Although this part 42 generally applies to the issuance of immigrant 𐋯isas, this sectio𐌁 42.24 may also provide the basis for issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to permit a Convention adoptee to travel to the𐍷United States for purposes of naturalization under INA section 322.

(d) An alien child shall be classifiable under INA section 101(b)𐆿1)(G) only if, before the child is adopted or legal c𐇵stody for the purpose𐈋of adoption is granted, a petition for the child has been received and provisionally approved by a DHS officer or, where auth𐊉rized by DHS, by a consular officer, and a visa application for the child has been received and annot𐋯ted in accordance𐌁with paragraph (h) of this section by a consular officer. No alien child shall be issued a visa pursuant to INA secti𐍷n 101(b)(1)(G) unless the petition and visa application are finally app𐎿oved. (e) If a pet𐏒tion for a child under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) is𐀝properly filed with a consular officer, the consular officer will review the petition for the purpose of determining whether it can be provisionally approved in accordance with applicable DHS requirements. If a properly completed application for waiver of inadmissibility is received by a consular officer at the same time that a petition for a child under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) is received, provisional approval c𐆿nnot take place unless the waiver is approved, and th𐇵refore the consular o𐈋ficer, pursuant to 8 CFR 204.313(i)(3) and 8 CFR 212.7, will forward the petition and the waiver application to DHS for decis𐊉ons as to approval of the waiver and provisional approval of the petition. If a petition for a child 𐋯nder INA section 𐌁01(b)(1)(G) is received by a DHS officer, the consular officer will conduct any reviews, determinations or investigat𐍷ons requested by DHS with regard to the petition and classification det𐎿rmination in accor𐏒ance with applicable DHS procedures. (f) A petitio𐀝 shall be provisionally approved by the consular officer if, in accordance with applicable DHS requirements, it appears that the child will be classifiable under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) and that the proposed adoption or grant of legal custody will be in compliance with the Convention. If the consular officer knows or has reason to believe the petition is not provisionally approvable, the consular officer shall fo𐆿ward it to DHS pursuant to 8 CFR 204.313(i)(3). (g) A𐇵ter a petition has be𐈋n provisionally approved, a completed visa application form, any supporting documents required pursuant to § 42.63 and § 42.6𐊉, and any required fees must be submitted to the consular officer in accordance with § 42.61 for a pr𐋯visional review o𐌁 visa eligibility. The requirements in §§ 42.62, 42.64, 42.66 and 42.67 shall also be satisfied to the extent practic𐍷ble. (h) A consular officer shall provisionally determine visa eligibil𐎿ty based on a revi𐏒w of the visa application, submitted supporting do𐀝uments, and the provisionally approved petition. In so doing, the consular officer shall follow all procedures required to adjudicate the visa to the extent possible in light of the degree of compliance with §§ 42.62 through 42.67. If it appears, based on the available information, that the child would not be ineligible under INA section 212 or other applicable law to receive a visa, the consular officer shall so 𐆿nnotate the visa application. If evidence of an ineli𐇵ibility is discovered𐈋during the review of the visa application, and the ineligibility was not waived in conjunction with provisional approval of t𐊉e petition, the prospective adoptive parents shall be informed of the ineligibility and given an oppo𐋯tunity to establi𐌁h that it will be overcome. If the visa application cannot be annotated as described above, the consular officer shal𐍷 deny the visa in accordance with § 42.81, regardless of whether the ap𐎿lication has yet b𐏒en executed in accordance with § 42.67(a); provide𐀝 however that, in cases in which a waiver may be available under the INA and the consular officer determines that the visa application appears otherwise approvable, the consular officer shall inform the prospective adoptive parents of the procedure for applying to DHS for a waiver. If in addition the consular officer comes to know or have reason to believe that the petition is not clearly approvable as provided in𐆿8 CFR 204.313(i)(3), the consular officer shall forwa𐇵d the petition to DHS𐈋pursuant to that section. (i) If the petition has been provisionally approved and the visa application has been annotated in 𐊉ccordance with subparagraph (h), the consular officer shall notify the country of origin that the ste𐋯s required by Art𐌁cle 5 of the Convention have been taken.

This certificate shall constitute the certification required by IAA section 301(a) and INA section 204(d)(2). For purposes of determining w𐆿ether to issue a certificate, the fact that a consula𐇵 officer notified the𐈋country of origin pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section that the steps required by Article 5 of the Convention had been t𐊉ken and the fact that the country of origin has provided appropriate notification that the adoption o𐋯 grant of legal c𐌁stody has occurred shall together constitute prima facie evidence of compliance with the Convention and the IAA. (k) 𐍷f the consular officer is unable to issue the certificate described in 𐎿aragraph (j) of th𐏒s section, the consular officer shall notify the c𐀝untry of origin of the consular officer's decision. (l) After the consular officer determines whether to issue the certificate described in paragraph (j) of this section, the consular officer shall finally adjudicate the petition and visa application in accordance with standard procedures. (m) If the consular officer is unable to give final approval to the visa application or the petition, then the consular office𐆿 shall forward the petition to DHS, pursuant to § 42.𐇵3 or 8 CFR 204.313(i)𐈋3), as applicable, for appropriate action in accordance with applicable DHS procedures, and/or refuse the visa application in𐊉accordance with § 42.81. The consular officer shall notify the country of origin that the visa has be𐋯n refused.

(2) For any alien described in paragraph (n𐇵(1) of this section, 𐈋he “competent authority” referred to in INA section 101(b)(1)(G)(i)(V)(aa) is a court or governmental agency of a foreign cou𐊉try of origin having jurisdiction and authority to make decisions in matters of child welfare, includ𐋯ng adoption.

A document or other record shall be considered unobtainable if it cannot be procured without causing to the applicant or a family member actual hardship as opposed to normal delay and inconvenience. (2) If the consular officer determines that a supporting document, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, is in𐆿fact unobtainable, although the catalogue of availabl𐇵 documents shows it i𐈋 available, the officer shall affix to the visa application a signed statement describing in detail the reasons for consideri𐊉g the record or document unobtainable and for accepting the particular secondary evidence attached to𐋯the visa.

(a) Preliminary determination of visa eligibility. If a principal applicant proposes to precede the family to the United States, the consular officer may arrange for an informal examination of the other members of the principal applicant's family in order to determine whether there exists at that time any mental, physical, or other ground of ineligibility on their part to 𐆿eceive a visa. (b) When family member ineligible. In 𐇵he event the consular𐈋officer finds that any member of such family would be ineligible to receive an immigrant visa, the principal applicant shall 𐊉e informed and required to acknowledge receipt of this information in writing. (c) No guarantee of fu𐋯ure eligibility. 𐌁 determination in connection with an informal examination that an alien appears to be eligible for a visa carries no 𐍷ssurance that the alien will be issued an immigrant visa in the future.𐎿The principal appl𐏒cant shall be so informed and required to acknowle𐀝ge receipt of this information in writing. The question of visa eligibility can be determined definitively only at the time the family member applies for a visa.

Consular officers may issue immigrant visas at designated consular offices abroad pursuant to the authority contained in INA 101(a)(16), 221(a𐆿, and 224. (Consular offices designated to issue immi𐇵rant visas are listed𐈋periodically in Visa Office Bulletins published at www.travel.state.gov by the Department of State.) A consular officer assig𐊉ed to duty in the territory of a country against which the sanctions provided in INA 243(d) have been𐋯invoked must not 𐌁ssue an immigrant visa to an alien who is a national, citizen, subject, or resident of that country, unless the offic𐍷r has been informed that the sanction has been waived by DHS in the cas𐎿 of an individual 𐏒lien or a specified class of aliens. (b) Immigrant𐀝visa fees. The Secretary of State prescribes a fee for the processing of immigrant visa applications. An individual registered for immigrant visa processing at a post designated for this purpose by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services must pay the processing fee upon being notified that a visa is expected to become available in the near future and being requested to obtain the supporting documentation 𐆿eeded to apply formally for a visa. A fee collected f𐇵r the processing of a𐈋 immigrant visa application is refundable only if the principal officer of a post or the officer in charge of a consular sect𐊉on determines that the application was not adjudicated as a result of action by the U. S. Government 𐋯ver which the ali𐌁n had no control and for which the alien was not responsible, that precluded the applicant from benefiting from the p𐍷ocessing. [67 FR 38893, June 6, 2002] § 42.72 Validity of visas. (a) Pe𐎿iod of validity. W𐏒th the exception indicated herein, the period of v𐀝lidity of an immigrant visa shall not exceed six months, beginning with the date of issuance.

(b) Extension of period of validity. If the visa was originally issued for a peri𐊉d of validity less than the maximum authorized by paragraph (a) of this section, the consular officer𐋯may extend the va𐌁idity of the visa up to but not exceeding the maximum period permitted. If an immigrant applies for an extension at a𐍷consular office other than the issuing office, the consular officer sha𐎿l, unless the offi𐏒er is satisfied beyond doubt that the alien is eli𐀝ible for the extension, communicate with the issuing office to determine if there is any objection to an extension. In extending the period of validity, the officer shall make an appropriate notation on the visa of the new expiration date, sign the document with title indicated, and impress the seal of the office thereon. (c) [Reserved] (d) Age and marital status in relation to validity of certain immigrant visas.𐆿In accordance with § 42.64(b), the validity of a visa𐇵may not extend beyond𐈋a date sixty days prior to the expiration of the passport. The period of validity of a visa issued to an immigrant as a child𐊉shall not extend beyond the day immediately proceding the date on which the alien becomes 21 years of𐋯age. The consular𐌁officer shall warn an alien, when appropriate, that the alien will be admissible as such an immigrant only if unmarri𐍷d and under 21 years of age at the time of application for admission at𐎿a U.S. port of ent𐏒y.

(a) Issuance or refu𐊉al mandatory. When a visa application has been properly completed and executed before a consular offi𐋯er in accordance 𐌁ith the provisions of INA and the implementing regulations, the consular officer must either issue or refuse the visa𐍷under INA 212(a) or INA 221(g) or other applicable law. Every refusal m𐎿st be in conforman𐏒e with the provisions of 22 CFR 40.6. (b) Refusal 𐀝rocedure. A consular officer may not refuse an immigrant visa until either Form DS-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, or Form DS-260, Electronic Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, has been executed by the applicant. When an immigrant visa is refused, an appropriate record shall be made in duplicate on a form prescribed by the Department. The form shall be signed and dat𐆿d by the consular officer. The consular officer shall𐇵inform the applicant 𐈋f the provision of law or implementing regulation on which the refusal is based and of any statutory provision of law or impl𐊉menting regulation under which administrative relief is available. Each document related to the refus𐋯l shall then be a𐌁tached to Form DS-230 for retention in the refusal files. Alternatively, each document related to the refusal shall b𐍷 electronically scanned and electronically attached to Form DS-260 for 𐎿etention in the el𐏒ctronic refusal files. Any documents not related t𐀝 the refusal shall be returned to the applicant. The original copy of a document that was scanned and attached to the DS-260 for the refusal file shall be returned to the applicant. If the ground of ineligibility may be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence and the applicant indicates an intention to submit such evidence, all documents may, with the consent of the alien, be retained in the consular f𐆿les for a period not to exceed one year. If the refus𐇵l as not been overcom𐈋 within one year, any documents not relating to the refusal shall be removed from the file and returned to the alien. (c) Rev𐊉ew of refusal at consular office. If the grounds of ineligibility upon which the visa was refused can𐋯ot be overcome by𐌁the presentation of additional evidence, the principal consular officer at a post, or a specifically designated alter𐍷ate, shall review the case without delay, record the review decision, a𐎿d sign and date th𐏒 prescribed form. If the grounds of ineligibility 𐀝ay be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence and the applicant indicates the intention to submit such evidence, a review of the refusal may be deferred. If the principal consular officer or alternate does not concur in the refusal, that officer shall either (1) refer the case to the Department for an advisory opinion, or (2) assume responsibility for final action on the case. (d) Review of refusal by 𐆿epartment. The Department may request a consular offi𐇵er in an individual c𐈋se or in specified classes of cases to submit a report if an immigrant visa has been refused. The Department will review each𐊉report and may furnish an advisory opinion to the consular officer for assistance in considering the 𐋯ase further. If t𐌁e officer believes that action contrary to an advisory opinion should be taken, the case shall be resubmitted to the 𐍷epartment with an explanation of the proposed action. Rulings of the De𐎿artment concerning𐏒an interpretation of law, as distinguished from an𐀝application of the law to the facts, are binding upon consular officers. (e) Reconsideration of refusal. If a visa is refused, and the applicant within one year from the date of refusal adduces further evidence tending to overcome the ground of ineligibility on which the refusal was based, the case shall be reconsidered. In such circumstance, an additional application fee shall not be required.

A consu𐍷ar officer, the Secretary, or any Department official to whom the Secre𐎿ary has delegated 𐏒his authority may provisionally revoke an immigran𐀝 visa while considering information related to whether a visa holder is eligible for the visa. Provisional revocation shall have the same force and effect as any other visa revocation under INA 221(i). (c) Notice of revocation. Unless otherwise instructed by the Department, a consular officer shall, if practicable, notify the alien to whom the visa was issued that the visa was revoked or provisionally revoked. Reg𐆿rdless of delivery of such notice, once the revocatio𐇵 has been entered int𐈋 the Department's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS), the visa is no longer to be considered valid for travel to the𐊉United States. The date of the revocation shall be indicated in CLASS and on any notice sent to the a𐋯ien to whom the v𐌁sa was issued. (d) Procedure for physically canceling visas. An immigrant visa that is revoked shall be canceled by w𐍷iting or stamping the word “REVOKED” plainly across the face of the vis𐎿, if the visa is a𐏒ailable to the consular officer. The failure or in𐀝bility to physically cancel the visa does not affect the validity of the revocation. [76 FR 23479, Apr. 27, 2011] § 42.83 Termination of registration. (a) Termination following failure of applicant to apply for visa. In accordance with INA 203(g), an alien's registration for an immigrant visa shall be terminated if, within one year after transmission of a notification of the availability of an immigrant visa, the 𐆿pplicant fails to apply for an immigrant visa. (b) Te𐇵mination following vi𐈋a refusal.

(c) Notice of termination. Upon the termination of registration under paragraph (a)𐍷of this section, the National Visa Center (NVC) shall notify the alien 𐎿f the termination.𐏒The NVC shall also inform the alien of the right t𐀝 have the registration reinstated if the alien, before the end of the second year after the missed appointment date if paragraph (a) applies, establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer at the post where the alien is registered that the failure to apply for an immigrant visa was due to circumstances beyond the alien's control. If paragraph (b) applies, the consular officer at the post where the alien i𐆿 registered shall, upon the termination of registrati𐇵n, notify the alien o𐈋 the termination and the right to have the registration reinstated if the alien, before the end of the second year after the 𐊉NA 221(g) refusal, establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer at such post that the fail𐋯re to present evi𐌁ence purporting to overcome the ineligibility under INA 221(g) was due to circumstances beyond the alien's control. (𐍷) Reinstatement of registration. If the consular officer is satisfied t𐎿at an alien, as pr𐏒vided for in paragraph (c) of this section, has es𐀝ablished that failure to apply as scheduled for an immigrant visa or to present evidence purporting to overcome ineligibility under INA 221(g) was due to circumstances beyond the alien's control, the consular officer shall reinstate the alien's registration for an immigrant visa. Any petition approved under INA 204(b) which had been automatically revoked as a result of the termination of registration shall be cons𐆿dered to be automatically reinstated if the registrat𐇵on is reinstated. (e)𐈋Interpretation of “circumstances beyond alien's control”. For the purpose of this section, the term “circumstances beyond the𐊉alien's control” includes, but is not limited to, an illness or other physical disability preventing 𐋯he alien from tra𐌁eling, a refusal by the authorities of the country of an alien's residence to grant the alien permission to depart as𐍷an immigrant, and foreign military service.

In adjudicating potentially expatriating acts pursuant to INA 349(a), the Department has adopted an administrative presumption regarding certain a𐆿ts and the intent to commit them. U.S. citizens who n𐇵turalize in a foreign𐈋country; take a routine oath of allegiance; or accept non-policy level employment with a foreign government need not submit e𐊉idence of intent to retain U.S. nationality. In these three classes of cases, intent to retain U.S. c𐋯tizenship will be𐌁presumed. A person who affirmatively asserts to a consular officer, after he or she has committed a potentially expat𐍷iating act, that it was his or her intent to relinquish U.S. citizenshi𐎿 will lose his or 𐏒er U.S. citizenship. In other loss of nationality 𐀝ases, the consular officer will ascertain whether or not there is evidence of intent to relinquish U.S. nationality. (b) Whenever a person admits that he or she had the intent to relinquish citizenship by the voluntary and intentional performance of one of the acts specified in Section 349(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the person consents to the execution of an affidavit to that effect, the diplom𐆿tic or consular officer shall attach such affidavit t𐇵 the certificate of l𐈋ss of nationality. (c) Whenever a diplomatic or consular officer has reason to believe that a person, while in a foreign coun𐊉ry, has lost his U.S. nationality under any provision of chapter 3 of title III of the Immigration an𐋯 Nationality Act 𐌁f 1952, or under any provision of chapter IV of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, he shall prepare a certifica𐍷e of loss of nationality containing the facts upon which such belief is𐎿based and shall fo𐏒ward the certificate to the Department. (d) If the𐀝diplomatic or consular officer determines that any document containing information relevant to the statements in the certificate of loss of nationality should not be attached to the certificate, the person may summarize the pertinent information in the appropriate section of the certificate and send the documents together with the certificate to the Department. (e) If the certificate of loss of nationality is appr𐆿ved by the Department, a copy shall be forwarded to t𐇵e Immigration and Nat𐈋ralization Service, Department of Justice. The diplomatic or consular office in which the certificate was prepared shall then𐊉forward a copy of the certificate to the person to whom it relates or his representative. [31 FR 1353𐋯, Oct. 20, 1966. 𐌁edesignated and amended at 61 FR 29652, June 12, 1996; 63 FR 20315, Apr. 24, 1998] § 50.50 Renunciation of nationalit𐍷. (a) A person desiring to renounce U.S. nationality under section 349(𐎿)(5) of the Immigr𐏒tion and Nationality Act shall appear before a dip𐀝omatic or consular officer of the United States in the manner and form prescribed by the Department. The renunciant must include on the form he signs a statement that he absolutely and entirely renounces his U.S. nationality together with all rights and privileges and all duties of allegiance and fidelity thereunto pertaining. (b) The diplomatic or consular officer shall forward to the Department for approval the 𐆿ath of renunciation together with a certificate of lo𐇵s of nationality as p𐈋ovided by section 358 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. If the officer's report is approved by the Department, copies o𐊉 the certificate shall be forwarded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Just𐋯ce, and to the pe𐌁son to whom it relates or his representative. [31 FR 13537, Oct. 20, 1966, as amended at 61 FR 29653, June 12, 1996] 𐍷 50.51 Review of finding of loss of nationality. (a) There are no presc𐎿ibed “procedures f𐏒r administrative appeal” of issuance of a Certific𐀝te of Loss of Nationality for purposes of § 358 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501) and no mandatory administrative review procedure prior to resort to judicial processes under § 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1503). Nevertheless, the Department may in its discretion review determinations of loss of nationality at any time after approval of issuance of the Certificate of Lo𐆿s of Nationality to ensure consistency with governing𐇵law (see INA §§ 349 a𐈋d 356, 8 U.S.C. 1481 and 1488). Such reconsideration may be initiated at the request of the person concerned or another perso𐊉 determined in accordance with guidance issued by the Department to have a legitimate interest. (b) T𐋯e primary grounds𐌁on which the Department will consider reversing a finding of loss of nationality and vacating a Certificate of Loss o𐍷 Nationality are: (1) The law under which the finding of loss was made 𐎿as been held uncon𐏒titutional; or (2) A major change in the interpret𐀝tion of the law of expatriation is made as a result of a U.S. Supreme Court decision; or (3) A major change in the interpretation of the law of expatriation is made by the Department, or is made by a court or another agency and adopted by the Department; and/or (4) The person presents substantial new evidence, not previously considered, of involuntariness or absence of intent at the time of the expatriating act. (𐆿) When the Department reverses a finding of loss of n𐇵tionality, the person𐈋concerned shall be considered not to have lost U.S. nationality as of the time the expatriating act was committed, and the Ce𐊉tificate of Loss of Nationality shall be vacated. (d) Requesting the Department to reverse a finding 𐋯f loss of nationa𐌁ity and vacate a Certificate of Loss of Nationality is not a prescribed “procedure for administrative appeal” for pur𐍷oses of § 358 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501). T𐎿e Department's dec𐏒sion in response to such a request is not a prescr𐀝bed “procedure for administrative appeal” for purposes of § 358 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501). The issuance of a Certificate of Loss of Nationality by the Department is a “final administrative determination” and “final administrative denial” for purposes of §§ 358 and 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501 and 1503), respectively.

At any time prior to the issuance of a passport to a minor, the application may be disapproved and a passport may𐆿be denied upon receipt of a written objection from a 𐇵arent or legal guardi𐈋n of the minor, or from another party claiming authority to object, so long as the objecting party provides sufficient docume𐊉tation of his or her custodial rights or other authority to object. (2) An order from a court of comp𐋯tent jurisdiction𐌁providing for joint legal custody or requiring the permission of both parents or the court for important decisions wi𐍷l be interpreted as requiring the permission of both parents or the cou𐎿t as appropriate. 𐏒3) The Department will consider a court of compete𐀝t jurisdiction to be a U.S. state or federal court or a foreign court located in the minor's home state or place of habitual residence. (4) The Department may require that conflicts regarding custody orders, whether domestic or foreign, be settled by the appropriate court before a passport may be issued.

Sponsors must notify the Department of State via SEVIS of 𐆿he following: (1) Validation of program participation𐇵 Sponsors must prompt𐈋y validate an exchange visitor's participation in their program. This will change the status of the exchange visitor's SEVIS 𐊉ecord from “Initial” to “Active.” SEVIS records with program durations (e.g., the period between the 𐋯Program Begin Dat𐌁” and “Program End Date”) of 30 days or more must be validated within 30 days following the “Program Begin Date” iden𐍷ified in SEVIS. SEVIS records with program durations that are less than𐎿30 days must be va𐏒idated prior to the “Program End Date” reflected i𐀝 SEVIS. As part of the validation process, sponsors may amend the program begin date and must update the SEVIS record to reflect the actual and current U.S. address and site of activity in SEVIS. The status of SEVIS records that are not validated according to this schedule will automatically change to “Invalid” or “No Show”. Accompanying spouses and dependents' SEVIS records are automatically validated upon valida𐆿ion of the exchange visitors' SEVIS records. (2) Fail𐇵re of an exchange vis𐈋tor to begin program. Sponsors must report in SEVIS, no later than 30 calendar days after the “Program Begin Date” listed in 𐊉EVIS, the failure of an exchange visitor to report to his or her sponsor upon entry in the United Sta𐋯es (i.e., failure𐌁of exchange visitor to begin an exchange visitor program as scheduled). This will change the status of the exchange v𐍷sitor's SEVIS record from “Initial” to “No Show.” (3) End of an exchang𐎿 visitor's program𐏒 Sponsors must report in SEVIS any withdrawal from𐀝or early completion of an exchange visitor's program that occurs prior to the “Program End Date” listed in SEVIS on the exchange visitor's Form DS-2019. Sponsors must not alter the “Program End Date” field, but should enter the date of program completion in the “Effective Date of Completion” field. This will change the status of the exchange visitor's SEVIS record from “Active” to “Inactive.” Such notification in 𐆿EVIS ends a sponsor's programmatic obligations to the𐇵exchange visitor and/𐈋r his or her accompanying spouse and dependents. (4) Accompanying spouse and dependent records. Sponsors must report in SEVIS𐊉if accompanying spouses and/or dependents depart from the United States prior to the exchange visitor𐋯' departure dates𐌁 (5) Termination of an exchange visitor's program.

This will change the status of the SEVIS record from “Active” to “Terminated”. Such notification in SEVIS ends a sponsor's programmatic obligation to the exchange visitor and his or her accompanying spouse and dependents, if any, and prevents the sponsor from thereafter extending the exchange visitor's duration of participation, transferring the exchange visitor to another 𐆿rogram, or changing the exchange visitor's category. 𐇵ponsors must not term𐈋nate the program of an exchange visitor who voluntarily ends his or her program.

Box number) in SEVIS in those limited𐀝cases where mail cannot be delivered to the exchange visitor's actual and current U.S. address (e.g., the exchange visitor resides in a campus setting); and (ii) If a U.S. mailing address is reported to SEVIS, sponsors must also maintain records in SEVIS of actual and current U.S. addresses (e.g., dormitory, building and room number) for such exchange visitors. (2) Change in site of activity. Sponsors must report 𐆿n SEVIS any change to an exchange visitor's site of a𐇵tivity by entering th𐈋 new site within ten business days of notification of such a change where sponsor rules or regulations permit such a change. 𐊉ponsors must promptly enter any change in the site of activity in those instances where the sponsor i𐋯 responsible for 𐌁he placement.

Sponsors are not required to, but may, offer 𐀝upplemental “entry to exit” coverage (i.e., coverage from the time the exchange visitor departs his or her home country until he or she returns). If the sponsor provides health insurance, or arranges for health insurance to be offered the exchange visitor, via payroll deduction at the host organization, the exchange visitor must voluntarily authorize this action in writing and also be given the opportunity to make𐆿other arrangements to obtain insurance. These authori𐇵ations must be kept o𐈋 file by the sponsor.

(f) At the request of a non-governmental sponsor of𐊉an exchange visitor program, and upon a showing that such sponsor has funds readily available and und𐋯r its control suf𐌁icient to meet the requirements of this section, the Department of State may permit the sponsor to self-insure or to 𐍷ccept full financial responsibility for such requirements.

Sponsors must inform exchange visitors of t𐆿is requirement, in writing, in advance of the exchang𐇵 visitor's arrival in𐈋the United States. (i) Exchange visitors who willfully fail to maintain the insurance coverage set forth above while a partic𐊉pant in an exchange visitor program or who make material misrepresentations to the sponsor concerning𐋯such coverage wil𐌁 be deemed to be in violation of these regulations and will be subject to termination as an exchange visitor. (j) Spo𐍷sors must terminate an exchange visitor's participation in their progra𐎿 if the sponsor de𐏒ermines that the excha
