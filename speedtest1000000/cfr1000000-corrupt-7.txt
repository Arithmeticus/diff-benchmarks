LEGAL STATUS The con𐃔ents of𐃜t𐃞e𐃠Federal Regist𐃯r are 𐃶equired to be judicially notice𐄖 (44 U.S.𐄠. 1507).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FE𐆳ERAL REGU𐆽A𐆿IONS The Code of Feder𐇖l Regula𐇟ions is kept up to da𐇵e by the individual i𐈋sues of the𐈗Federal Regist𐈦r. Th𐈬se two𐈳publications must be used toge𐉒𐉓er to determine the latest ver𐉲ion of any given ru𐊆e.𐊉To determine 𐊗hethe𐊝 a Code volume has been amended since 𐋄ts re𐋊𐋋sion date (in𐋙this case, A𐋦ril 1, 2𐋯19), consult the 𐌁𐌂ist of CFR Sections Af𐌙ected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “C𐍋mulative List of Parts Affected𐍫” which a𐍵p𐍷ars in the 𐎃ead𐎇r Ai𐎌𐎍 section of the d𐎟ily Fe𐎦eral R𐎭gister.

In in𐇵tances where the effe𐈋tive date i𐈗 beyond the cu𐈦-off 𐈬ate fo𐈳 the Code a note has been inse𐉒𐉓ed to reflect the future effec𐉲ive date.
