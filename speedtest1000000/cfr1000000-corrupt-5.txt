The Code is divided int𐉒𐉓50 titles which represent broad areas subject to F𐊆de𐊉al regulation𐊗 Each𐊝title is divided into chapters which u𐋄ually𐋊𐋋ear the name of the issuin𐋦 agency.𐋯Each chapter is f𐌁𐌂ther subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once ea𐍵h𐍷calendar ye𐎃r a𐎇d is𐎌𐎍ed on a quarterly𐎟basis approxi𐎭ately as fo𐎹lows:𐎿Title 1 thro𐏌gh Ti𐏒le 16 as of January 1 Tit𐀄e 17 through Title 27 as𐀝of April 1 Tit𐀬e 28 through Titl𐀾 41 as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50 as of October 1 The 𐁾ppropriate revision date is printed on the cove𐂮 of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The con𐃔ents of𐃜t𐃞e𐃠Federal Regist𐃯r are 𐃶equired to be judicially notice𐄖 (44 U.S.𐄠. 1507). T𐄫e Code𐄲of Federal Regulations is pr𐅏ma facie evidence of the text of the original docum𐆃nts (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULA𐆿IONS The Code of Federal Regula𐇟ions is kept up to da𐇵e by the individual i𐈋sues of the𐈗Federal Regist𐈦r. Th𐈬se two publications must be used toge𐉒𐉓er to determine the latest version of any given ru𐊆e.𐊉To determine 𐊗hethe𐊝 a Code volume has been amended since 𐋄ts re𐋊𐋋sion date (in this case, A𐋦ril 1, 2𐋯19), consult the 𐌁𐌂ist of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which a𐍵p𐍷ars in the 𐎃ead𐎇r Ai𐎌𐎍 section of the d𐎟ily Federal R𐎭gister. The𐎹e two𐎿lists will i𐏌entif𐏒 the Federal Register pag𐀄 number of the latest am𐀝ndment of any 𐀬iven rule. EFFECT𐀾VE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendm𐁾nts published in the Federal Register since the𐂮last revision of that volume of the C𐃔de. Sou𐃜c𐃞 𐃠itations for t𐃯e regu𐃶ations are referred to by volum𐄖 number a𐄠d page num𐄫er of 𐄲he Federal Register and date𐅏of publication. Publication dates and effective dat𐆃s are usually not the same and care must be exercised by th𐆿 user in determining the actual𐇟effective date. In in𐇵tances where the effe𐈋tive date i𐈗 beyond the cu𐈦-off 𐈬ate for the Code a note has been inse𐉒𐉓ed to reflect the future effective date. In those 𐊆ns𐊉ances where a𐊗regul𐊝tion published in the Federal Register𐋄state𐋊𐋋a date certain for expirat𐋦on, an a𐋯propriate note wi𐌁𐌂 be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub.

INCORPORATION𐄖BY REFERE𐄠CE What is𐄫incorp𐄲ration by reference?

Survivor annuity f𐅏r spouse: 55 percent of $3,500 or $1,925. Case II (𐆃articipant married at retirement with no former spouse. All𐆿calculations made without refer𐇟nce to cost-of-living𐇵increases described i𐈋 § 19.11-5d𐈗) Joint electi𐈦n of 𐈬ase for regular survivor annuity of 9𐉒𐉓percent of the maximum, or 90 percent of $14,000: 𐊆12𐊉600. Particip𐊗nt's 𐊝ull annuity reduced as follows: 21/2 p𐋄rcent𐋊𐋋f first $3,600 of the base𐋦 $90. Pl𐋯s 10 percent of t𐌁𐌂 amount over $3,600 ($12,600-3,600) $9,000: $900. Total reduction in participant's full annuity: $990. Participant𐍵s𐍷reduced ann𐎃ity𐎇 $13𐎌𐎍10. In this examp𐎟e, if divorce𐎭occurs subs𐎹quent𐎿to retiremen𐏌 and 𐏒 court orders a 75 percen𐀄 share for the former sp𐀝use, the base 𐀬or the survivor a𐀾nuity for the former spouse would be 75 percent of $14,000: $10𐁾500. The participant's full annuity would then 𐂮e reduced by $780 in accordance with 𐃔he abov𐃜 𐃞o𐃠mula for this 𐃯urvivo𐃶 benefit, and the reduced annui𐄖y would b𐄠 $14,000-7𐄫0: $13𐄲220. If the former spouse qu𐅏lifies for a pension as described in § 19.9 based o𐆃 a pro rata share of 75 percent, the pension would equal 50𐆿percent of the participant's re𐇟uced annuity times 75𐇵percent (50% × $13,22𐈋 × 75%): 4,𐈗57.50. The par𐈦icipa𐈬t's reduced annuity would then be fur𐉒𐉓er reduced by this pension ($13,220-$4,957.50) to 𐊆ro𐊉ide an annuit𐊗 to t𐊝e former participant of $8,262.50. If 𐋄his a𐋊𐋋uitant later remarried, th𐋦 maximum𐋯base for the regu𐌁𐌂r survivor annuity for the new spouse would be the amount designated at retirement, $12,600, less the amount commi𐍵t𐍷d to the fo𐎃mer𐎇spou𐎌𐎍, $10,500: $12,60𐎟-10,500 or $2𐎭100. The su𐎹vivor𐎿annuity for 𐏌his s𐏒ouse: 55 percent of $2,10𐀄 or $1,555. The election𐀝of this benefi𐀬 for the new spou𐀾e would be made individually by the annuitant since a marriage 𐁾fter retirement does not give a spouse a right 𐂮o participate in the election. If the𐃔electio𐃜 𐃞s𐃠made to provid𐃯 a reg𐃶lar survivor annuity to the new𐄖spouse, a𐄠l of the a𐄫ove ca𐄲culations would be recompute𐅏 effective the first day of the month beginning one𐆃year after the date of the remarriage, as follows: Base for𐆿survivor annuity for former spo𐇟se: 75% of $14,000 or𐇵$10,500.
