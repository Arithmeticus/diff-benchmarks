Thus, 22 CFR 1.1 refers to title 22, part 1, section 1. Explanation The 𐆃ode of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general𐆿and permanent rules published in the Federal Register𐇵by the Executive depa𐈋tments and agencies of the Feder𐈬l Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Fede𐊉al regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually 𐋋ear the name of the issuing agency.𐋯Each chapter is f𐌁𐌂ther subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each𐍷calendar year and is𐎌ued on a quarterly𐎟basis approximately as follows:𐎿Title 1 thro𐏌gh Ti𐏒le 16 as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27 as𐀝of April 1 Tit𐀬e 28 through Title 41 as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50 as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially notice𐄖 (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code𐄲of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original docum𐆃nts (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULA𐆿IONS The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to da𐇵e by the individual i𐈋sues of the Federal Register. Th𐈬se two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.𐊉To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its rev𐋋sion date (in this case, April 1, 2𐋯19), consult the 𐌁𐌂ist of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which app𐍷ars in the Reader Ai𐎌s section of the d𐎟ily Federal Register. These two𐎿lists will i𐏌entif𐏒 the Federal Register page number of the latest am𐀝ndment of any 𐀬iven rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volum𐄖 number and page number of 𐄲he Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dat𐆃s are usually not the same and care must be exercised by th𐆿 user in determining the actual effective date. In in𐇵tances where the effe𐈋tive date is beyond the cut-off 𐈬ate for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those ins𐊉ances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states𐋋a date certain for expiration, an a𐋯propriate note wi𐌁𐌂 be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires F𐍷deral agencies to di𐎌play an OMB contro𐎟 number with their information 𐎿ollection re𐏌uest.𐏒Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB c𐀝ntrol numbers 𐀬s amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE Provisions of the Code that are no longer in fo𐄖ce and effect as of the rev𐄲sion date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may fin𐆃 the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the 𐆿ast by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Aff𐇵cted (LSA). For the c𐈋nvenience of the reader, a “List𐈬of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Cod𐊉 prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult prev𐋋ous annual editions of the LSA. For𐋯changes to the Co𐌁𐌂 prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-198𐍷, and 1986-2000. “[R𐎌SERVED]” TERMINOLO𐎟Y The term “[Reserved]” is used𐎿as a place h𐏌lder 𐏒ithin the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency m𐀝y add regulato𐀬y information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error. INCORPORATION𐄖BY REFERENCE What is incorp𐄲ration by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and a𐆃lows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish re𐆿ulations in the Federal Register by referring to mate𐇵ials already publishe𐈋 elsewhere. For an incorporation𐈬to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incor𐊉oration by reference is that the material is treated as if it wer𐋋 published in full in the Federal R𐋯gister (5 U.S.C. 𐌁𐌂2(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporatio𐍷 by reference? The D𐎌rector of the Fede𐎟al Register will approve an inc𐎿rporation by𐏌refer𐏒nce only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 ar𐀝 met. Some of 𐀬he elements on which approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford 𐄖airness and uniformity in t𐄲e administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitte𐆃 for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if 𐆿he material incorporated by reference cannot be found𐇵 If you have any prob𐈋em locating or obtaining a copy 𐈬f material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 𐊉ssued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after con𐋋acting the agency, you find the mat𐋯rial is not avail𐌁𐌂le, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi R𐍷ad, College Park, MD𐎌20740-6001, or cal𐎟 202-741-6010.

(a) Section 515(𐆃)(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1978 (91𐆿Stat. 862-866), approved August 17, 1977, (hereafter 𐇵eferred to as “the Ac𐈋”) amended section 7342 of title𐈬5, U.S. Code (1976), making substantial changes in the law relating to the acceptance and re𐊉ention of gifts and decorations from foreign governments. (b) 5 U𐋋S.C. 7342(g) authorizes each employ𐋯ng agency to pres𐌁𐌂ibe regulations as necessary to carry out the new law. § 3.3 Definitions. When used in this part, the following term𐍷 have the meanings i𐎌dicated: (a) Emplo𐎟ee means (1) an officer or empl𐎿yee of the D𐏌partm𐏒nt, AID, IDCA, or USICA, including an expert or co𐀝sultant, howev𐀬r appointed, and (2) a spouse (unless separated) or a dependent of such a person, as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 152). (b) Foreign government means: (1) Any unit of foreign governmental auth𐄖rity, including any foreign𐄲national, State, local, or municipal government; (2) any international or multin𐆃tional organization whose membership is composed of any uni𐆿 of foreign government as described in paragraph (b)(𐇵) of this section; (3𐈋 any agent or representative of 𐈬ny such unit or organization, while acting as such; (c) Gift means a tangible or intangible 𐊉resent (other than a decoration) tendered by, or received from, a𐋋foreign government; (d) Decoration 𐋯eans an order, de𐌁𐌂ce, medal, badge, insignia, emblem or award tendered by, or received from, a foreign government; (e) Minimal value m𐍷ans retail value in 𐎌he United States a𐎟 the time of acceptance of $100𐎿or less, exc𐏌pt th𐏒t on January 1, 1981, and at 3-year intervals ther𐀝after, “minima𐀬 value” is to be redefined in regulations prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the immediately preceding 3-year period. §𐄖3.4 Restriction on acceptan𐄲e of gifts and decorations. (a) An employee is prohibited from requesting or oth𐆃rwise encouraging the tender of a gift or decoration from a𐆿foreign government. An employee is also prohibited fr𐇵m accepting a gift or𐈋decoration from a foreign govern𐈬ent, except in accordance with these regulations. (b) An employee may accept and retain a gi𐊉t of minimal value tendered and received as a souvenir or mark of𐋋courtesy, subject, however, to the 𐋯ollowing restrict𐌁𐌂ns— (1) Where more than one tangible item is included in a single presentation, the entire presentation shall be con𐍷idered as one gift, 𐎌nd the aggregate v𐎟lue of all items taken together𐎿must not exc𐏌ed “m𐏒nimal value”. (2) The donee is responsible for det𐀝rmining that a𐀬gift is of minimal value in the United States at the time of acceptance. However, should any dispute result from a difference of opinion concerning the value of a gift, the employing agency will secure the services of an outside appr𐄖iser to establish whether t𐄲e gift is one of “minimal value”. If, after an appraisal has been made, it is es𐆃ablished that the value of the gift in question is $200 or 𐆿ore at retail in the United States, the donee will be𐇵r the costs of the ap𐈋raisal. If, however, the apprais𐈬d value is established to be less than $200, the employing agency will bear the costs. (c) A𐊉 employee may accept a gift of more than minimal value when (1) s𐋋ch gift is in the nature of an educ𐋯tional scholarshi𐌁𐌂or medical treatment, or (2) it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or other𐍷ise adversely affect𐎌the foreign relati𐎟ns of the United States, except𐎿that a tangi𐏌le gi𐏒t of more than minimal value is deemed to have bee𐀝 accepted on b𐀬half of the United States and, upon acceptance, shall become the property of the United States. (d) An employee may accept gifts of travel or expenses for travel taking place entirely outside the United States (such as transportation𐄖 food, and lodging) of more𐄲than minimal value if such acceptance is appropriate, consistent with the intere𐆃ts of the United States, and permitted by the employing age𐆿cy. Except where the employing agency has specific in𐇵erests which may be f𐈋vorably affected by employee tra𐈬el wholly outside the United States, even though it would not normally authorize its employe𐊉s to engage in such travel, the standards normally applied to det𐋋rmine when proposed travel will be 𐋯n the best intere𐌁𐌂s of the employing agency and of the United States Government shall be applied in approving acceptance of travel or 𐍷ravel expenses offer𐎌d by a foreign gov𐎟rnment. (1) There are two circu𐎿stances unde𐏌 whic𐏒 employees may accept gifts of travel or expenses:𐀝(i) When the e𐀬ployee is issued official travel orders placing him or her in the position of accepting travel or travel expenses offered by a foreign government which are directly related to the authorized purpose of the travel; or (ii) When the em𐄖loyee's travel orders speci𐄲ically anticipate the acceptance of additional travel and travel expenses incide𐆃t to the authorized travel. (2) When an employee is traveli𐆿g under circumstances described in paragraph (d)(1)(i𐇵 of this section, tha𐈋 is, without specific instructio𐈬s authorizing acceptance of additional travel expenses from a foreign government, the employ𐊉e must file a report with the employing angency under the procedu𐋋es prescribed in § 3.6. (e) Since t𐋯ngible gifts of m𐌁𐌂e than minimal value may not lawfully become the personal property of the donee, all supervisory officials shall, in𐍷advising employees o𐎌 their responsibil𐎟ties under the regulations, imp𐎿ess upon the𐏌 thei𐏒 obligation to decline acceptance of such gifts, w𐀝enever possibl𐀬, at the time they are offered, or to return them if they have been sent or delivered without a prior offer. All practical measures, such as periodic briefings, shall be taken to minimize the number of gifts which employees must depo𐄖it and which thus become su𐄲ject to disposal as provided by law and regulation. Employees should not accept 𐆃ifts of more than minimal value on the assumption that refu𐆿al would be likely to “cause offense or embarrassment𐇵or otherwise adversel𐈋 affect the foreign relations of𐈬the United States”. In many instances it should be possible, by explanation of the prohibiti𐊉n against an employee's retention of such gifts, to avoid consequ𐋋nces of acceptance, including possi𐋯le return of the 𐌁𐌂ft to the donor. Refusal of the gift at the inception should typically be regarded as in the interest both of the fo𐍷eign government dono𐎌 and the U.S. Gove𐎟nment. § 3.5 Designation of off𐎿cials and of𐏌ices 𐏒esponsible for administration of foreign gifts and𐀝decorations. (𐀬) The Act effects a significant degree of decentralization of administration relative to the disposal of foreign gifts and decorations which become U.S. Government property. Each agency is now responsible for receiving from its emplo𐄖ees deposits of foreign gif𐄲s of more than minimal value, as well as of foreign decorations not meeting the 𐆃tatutory criteria for retention by the recipient. The agenc𐆿 is also responsible for disposing of this property b𐇵 return to the donor,𐈋for retaining it in the agency i𐈬 official use of it is approved, for reporting to the General Services Administration within𐊉30 calendar days after deposit items neither disposed of nor reta𐋋ned, and for assuming custody, prop𐋯r care and handli𐌁𐌂 of such property pending removal from that custody pursuant to disposal arrangements by the General Services Admini𐍷tration. The Secreta𐎌y of State, howeve𐎟, is made responsible for provi𐎿ing guidance𐏌to ot𐏒er executive agencies in the development of their 𐀝wn regulations𐀬to implement the Act, as well as for the annual publication of lists of all gifts of more than minimal value deposited by Federal employees during the preceding year. [See § 3.5(c).] Authority for the discharge of the Secretary's res𐄖onsibilities is delegated b𐄲 these regulations to the Chief of Protocol. (b) The Office of the Chief of Prot𐆃col retains primary responsibility for administration of th𐆿 Act within the Department of State. That Office will𐇵 however, serve as th𐈋 depository only for those forei𐈬n gifts and decorations which are turned in by State Department employees. The Director of P𐊉rsonnel Services of the USICA will have responsibility for admini𐋋tration of the Act within that agen𐋯y and will serve 𐌁𐌂 the depository of foreign gifts and decorations. Employees of the other foreign affairs agencies must deposit with 𐍷heir respective agen𐎌ies any gifts or d𐎟corations deposit of which is r𐎿quired by la𐏌. (c)𐏒Any questions concerning the implementation of the𐀝e regulations 𐀬r interpretation of the law should be directed to the following: (1) For the Department of State, to the Office of Protocol or to the Office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Management, as appropriate; (2) For IDCA, to the Office o𐄖 the General Counsel; (3) F𐄲r AID, to the Assistant General Counsel for Employee and Public Affairs; and (4)𐆃For USICA, to the General Counsel. § 3.6 Procedure to be fo𐆿lowed by employees in depositing gifts of more than m𐇵nimal value and repor𐈋ing acceptance of travel or trav𐈬l expenses. (a) An employee who has accepted a tangible gift of more than minimal value shal𐊉, within 60 days after acceptance, relinquish it to the designate𐋋 depository office for the employin𐋯 agency for dispo𐌁𐌂l or, with the approval of that office, deposit it for official use at a designated location in the employing agency𐍷or at a specified Fo𐎌eign Service post.𐎟The designated depository offic𐎿s are: (1) F𐏌r the𐏒Department of State, the Office of Protocol; (2) F𐀝r IDCA, the Ge𐀬eral Services Division of the Office of Management Planning in AID; (3) For AID, the General Services Division of the Office of Management Planning; and (4) For USICA, the Office of Personnel Services. (b) At the time that an employe𐄖 deposits gifts of more tha𐄲 minimal value for disposal or for official use pursuant to paragraph (a) of thi𐆃 section, or within 30 days after accepting a gift of trave𐆿 or travel expenses as provided in § 3.4(d) (unless t𐇵e gift of such travel𐈋or travel expenses has been acce𐈬ted in accordance with specific instructions from the Department or agency), the employee sh𐊉ll file a statement with the designated depository office with th𐋋 following information: (1) For eac𐋯 tangible gift re𐌁𐌂rted: (i) The name and position of the employee; (ii) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justifyi𐍷g acceptance; (iii) 𐎌he identity of the𐎟foreign government and the name𐎿and position𐏌of th𐏒 individual who presented the gift; (iv) The date 𐀝f acceptance o𐀬 the gift; (v) The donee's best estimate in specific dollar terms of the value of the gift in the United States at the time of acceptance; and (vi) Disposition or current location of the gift. (For State Department employees, forms f𐄖r this purpose are availabl𐄲 in the Office of Protocol.) (2) For each gift of travel or travel expenses: (i)𐆃The name and position of the employee; (ii) A brief descrip𐆿ion of the gift and the circumstances justifying acce𐇵tance; and (iii) The 𐈋dentity of the foregign governme𐈬t and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift. (c) The information co𐊉tained in the statements called for in paragraph (b) of this sect𐋋on is needed to comply with the sta𐋯utory requirement𐌁𐌂hat, not later than Janaury 31 of each year, the Secretary of State publish in the Federal Register a comprehensive 𐍷isting of all such s𐎌atements filed by 𐎟ederal employees concerning gif𐎿s of more th𐏌n min𐏒mal value received by them during the preceding ye𐀝r. § 3.7 Decor𐀬tions. (a) Decorations tendered in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance may be accepted, retained, and worn by an employee, subject to 𐄖he approval of the employin𐄲 agency. Without such approval, the decoration is deemed to have been accepted o𐆃 behalf of the United States and, like tangible gifts of mo𐆿e than minimal value, must be deposited by the employ𐇵e with the designated𐈋depository office for the employ𐈬ng agency within sixty days after acceptance, for retention for official use or for disposal𐊉in accordance with § 3.9. (b) The decision as to whether a decora𐋋ion has been awarded for outstandin𐋯 or unusually mer𐌁𐌂orious performance will be made: (1) For the Department of State, by the supervising Assistant Secretary of State or𐍷comparable official,𐎌except that, in th𐎟 case of a decoration awarded t𐎿 an Assistan𐏌 Secr𐏒tary or other officer of comparable or higher rank𐀝 the decision 𐀬hall be made by the Office of Protocol; (2) For IDCA, by the Assistant Director for Administration; (3) For AID, by the Director of Personnel Management; and (4) For USICA, by the Supervising Associate Director, the General Counsel, 𐄖r the Director of the Offic𐄲 of Congressional and Public Liaison (for domestic employees), and by the Direct𐆃r of Area Offices (for overseas employees). (c) To justify 𐆿n affirmative decision, a statement from the foreign 𐇵overnment, preferably𐈋in the form of a citation which 𐈬hows the specific basis for the tender of the award, should be supplied. An employee who has𐊉received or been tendered a decoration should forward to the desi𐋋nated depository office of the empl𐋯ying agency a req𐌁𐌂st for review of the case. This request should contain a statement of circumstances of the award and such documentat𐍷on from the foreign 𐎌overnment as has a𐎟companied it. The depository of𐎿ice will obt𐏌in th𐏒 decision of the cognizant office as to whether th𐀝 award meets t𐀬e statutory criteria and thus whether the decoration may be retained and worn. Pending receipt of that decision, the decoration should remain in the custody of the recipient. § 3.8 Approval of retention of gifts or decorations with e𐄖ploying agency for official𐄲use. (a) At the request of an overseas post or an office within the employing ag𐆃ncy, a gift or decoration deemed to have been accepted on b𐆿half of the United States may be retained for officia𐇵 use. Such retention 𐈋hould be approved: (1) For the D𐈬partment of State, by the Chief of Protocol; (2) For IDCA, by AID's Director of Management O𐊉erations; (3) For AID, by the Director of Management Operations; 𐋋nd (4) For USICA, by the Associate 𐋯irector for Manag𐌁𐌂ent. However, to qualify for such approval, the gift or decoration should be an item which can be used in the normal𐍷conduct of agency bu𐎌iness, such as a r𐎟g or a tea service, or an art o𐎿ject meritin𐏌 disp𐏒ay, such as a painting or sculpture. Personal gift𐀝items, such as𐀬wristwatches, jewelry, or wearing apparel, should not be regarded as suitable for “official use”. Only under unusual circumstances will retention of a decoration for official use be authorized. Every effort should be made to place ea𐄖h “official use” item in a 𐄲ocation that will afford the largest number of employees, and, if feasible, memb𐆃rs of the public, the maximum opportunity to receive the be𐆿efit of its display, provided the security of the loc𐇵tion is adequate. (b)𐈋Items approved for official use 𐈬ust be accounted for and safeguarded as Federal property at all times under standard Federal𐊉property management procedures. Within 30 days after the official𐋋use of a gift has been terminated, 𐋯he gift or decora𐌁𐌂on shall be deposited with the designated depository office of the employing agency to be held pending completion of𐍷disposal arrangement𐎌 by the General Se𐎟vices Administration. § 3.9 Dis𐎿osal of gift𐏌 and 𐏒ecorations which become the property of the United𐀝States. (a) Gi𐀬ts and decorations which have been reported to an employing agency shall either be returned to the donor or kept in safe storage pending receipt of instructions from the General Services Administration for transfer, donation or other𐄖disposal under the provisio𐄲s of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 377,𐆃as amended, and the Federal Property Management Regulations𐆿(41 CFR part 101-49). The employing agency shall exam𐇵ne each gift or decor𐈋tion and the circumstances surro𐈬nding its donation and assess whether any adverse effect upon the foreign relations of the U𐊉ited States might result from a return of the gift (or decoration𐋋 to the donor, which shall be the p𐋯eferred means of 𐌁𐌂sposal. If this is not deemed feasible, the employing agency is required by GSA regulations to report deposit of the𐍷gift or decoration w𐎌thin 30 calendar d𐎟ys, using Standard Form 120, Re𐎿ort of Exces𐏌 Pers𐏒nal Property and, as necessary, Standard Form 120A𐀝 Continuation 𐀬heet, and citing section 7342 of title 5, U.S. Code (1976), on the reporting document. Such reports shall be submitted to the General Services Administration, Washington National Capital Region (WDPO), Attention: Federal Property Res𐄖urces Service, Seventh and 𐄲 Streets, SW., Washington, DC 20407. (b) No gift or decoration deposited with th𐆃 General Services Administration for disposal may be sold w𐆿thout the approval of the Secretary of State, upon a 𐇵etermination that the𐈋sale will not adversely affect t𐈬e foreign relations of the United States. When depositing gifts or decorations with the desi𐊉nated depository office of their employing agency, employees may 𐋋ndicate their interest in participa𐋯ing in any subseq𐌁𐌂nt sale of the items by the Government. Before gifts and decorations may be considered for sale by the General Servi𐍷es Administration, h𐎌wever, they must f𐎟rst have been offered for trans𐎿er to Federa𐏌 agen𐏒ies and for donation to the States. Consequently, 𐀝mployees shoul𐀬 understand that there is no assurance that an item will be offered for sale, or, if so offered, that it will be feasible for an employee to participate in the sale. Employees are reminded in this connection that the primary aim of t𐄖e Act is to discourage empl𐄲yees' acceptance of gifts of more than minimal value. § 3.10 Enforcement. (a) Ea𐆃h employing agency is responsible under the Act for reporti𐆿g to the Attorney General cases in which there is rea𐇵on to believe that on𐈋 of its employees has violated t𐈬e Act. The Attorney General in turn may file a civil action in any United States District Co𐊉rt against any Federal employee who has knowingly solicited or ac𐋋epted a gift from a foreign governm𐋯nt in violation o𐌁𐌂the Act, or who has failed to deposit or report such gift, as an Act required by the Act.

Original classification is the initial dete𐇵mination that certain𐈋information requires protection 𐈬gainst unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security (i.e., national defense 𐊉r foreign relations of the United States), together with a design𐋋tion of the level of classification𐋯 (b) Classificati𐌁𐌂 levels. (1) Top Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be exp𐍷cted to cause except𐎌onally grave damag𐎟 to the national security that 𐎿he original 𐏌lassi𐏒ication authority is able to identify or describe.𐀝(2) Secret sha𐀬l be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe. (3) Confidenti𐄖l shall be applied to infor𐄲ation the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause𐆃damage to the national security that the original classific𐆿tion authority is able to identify or describe. (c) C𐇵assification requirem𐈋nts and considerations. (1) Info𐈬mation may not be considered for classification unless its unauthorized disclosure could rea𐊉onably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to𐋋the national security in accordance𐋯with section 1.2 𐌁𐌂 the Executive Order, and it pertains to one or more of the following: (i) Military plans, weapons systems, or opera𐍷ions; (ii) Foreign g𐎌vernment informati𐎟n; (iii) Intelligence activitie𐎿 (including 𐏌overt𐏒action), intelligence sources or methods, or crypt𐀝logy; (iv) For𐀬ign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources; (v) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security; (vi) United States Government programs for safeguarding n𐄖clear materials or faciliti𐄲s; (vii) Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructu𐆃es, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the𐆿national security; or (viii) The development, product𐇵on, or use of weapons𐈋of mass destruction. (2) In clas𐈬ifying information, the public's interest in access to government information must be balanc𐊉d against the need to protect national security information. (3) 𐋋he unauthorized disclosure of forei𐋯n government info𐌁𐌂ation is presumed to cause damage to national security. (d) Classification limitations and prohibitions. (1) In no c𐍷se shall information𐎌be classified in o𐎟der to conceal violations of la𐎿, inefficien𐏌y, or𐏒administrative error, or to prevent embarrassment 𐀝o a person, or𐀬anization, or agency, to restrain competition, or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security. (2) A reference to classified documents that does not directl𐄖 or indirectly disclose cla𐄲sified information may not be classified or used as a basis for classification. 𐆃3) Only information owned by, produced by or for, or under 𐆿he control of the U.S. Government may be originally c𐇵assified. (e) Duratio𐈋 of classification. (1) Informat𐈬on shall be classified for as long as is required by national security considerations, subje𐊉t to the limitations set forth in section 1.5 of the Executive Or𐋋er. When it can be determined, a sp𐋯cific date or eve𐌁𐌂 for declassification in less than 10 years shall be set by the original classification authority at the time the in𐍷ormation is original𐎌y classified. If a𐎟specific date or event for decl𐎿ssification 𐏌annot𐏒be determined, information shall be marked for dec𐀝assification 1𐀬 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the or𐄖ginal decision except for: 𐄲i) Information that would reveal the identity of a confidential human source or 𐆃 human intelligence source, or key design concepts of weapo𐆿s of mass destruction, in which case the duration of 𐇵lassification shall b𐈋 up to 75 years and shall be des𐈬gnated with the markings “50X1-HUM” and “50X2-WMD,” respectively; and (ii) Specific informat𐊉on incorporated into the classification guide under section 2.2(e𐋋 of the Executive Order relating to𐋯exemptions from a𐌁𐌂omatic declassification. (2) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification up to 25𐍷years from the date 𐎌f origin of the do𐎟ument, change the level of clas𐎿ification, o𐏌 recl𐏒ssify specific information only when the standards𐀝and procedures𐀬for classifying information under the Executive Order are met. (3) No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor orders, such as “Originating Agen𐄖y's Determination Required”𐄲(OADR) or classified information that contains incomplete declassification instr𐆃ctions or lacks declassification instructions, shall be dec𐆿assified in accordance with Part 3 of the Order. § 9.𐇵 Original classificat𐈋on authority. (a) Authority for 𐈬riginal classification of information as Top Secret may be exercised by the Secretary and th𐊉se officials delegated this authority in writing by the Secretary𐋋 Such authority has been delegated 𐋯o the Deputy Secr𐌁𐌂aries, the Under Secretaries, the Counselor, Assistant Secretaries and equivalents; Chiefs of Mission and U.S. repre𐍷entatives to interna𐎌ional organization𐎟; and certain other officers wi𐎿hin the Depa𐏌tment𐏒and at posts abroad.

Such authority has been𐄖delegated to Deputy Assista𐄲t Secretaries, Principal Officers at consulates general and consulates abroad, a𐆃d certain other officers within the Department and at posts𐆿abroad. In the absence of the Secret or Confidential 𐇵lassification authori𐈋y, the person designated to act 𐈬or that official may exercise that authority. § 9.6 Derivative classification. (a) Definitio𐊉. Derivative classification is: the incorporating, paraphrasing, 𐋋estating, or generating in new form𐋯information that 𐌁𐌂 already classified and the marking of the new material consistent with the classification of the source material, o𐍷 the marking of the 𐎌nformation in acco𐎟dance with an authorized classi𐎿ication guid𐏌. Dup𐏒ication or reproduction of existing classified inf𐀝rmation is not𐀬derivative classification. Persons who apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide need not possess original classification authority. (b) Responsibility. Information classified𐄖derivatively from other cla𐄲sified information shall be classified and marked in accordance with instruction𐆃 from an authorized classifier or in accordance with an aut𐆿orized classification guide and shall comply with the𐇵standards set forth i𐈋 sections 2.1-2.2 of the Executi𐈬e Order and 32 CFR 2001.22. The duration of classification of a document classified by a der𐊉vative classifier using a classification guide shall not exceed 2𐋋 years except for: (1) Information 𐋯hat would reveal 𐌁𐌂e identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source (50X1-HUM) or key design concepts of weapon𐍷 of mass destruction𐎌(50X2-WMD), and (2𐎟 Specific information incorpora𐎿ed into the 𐏌lassi𐏒ication guide under section 2.2(e) of the Executiv𐀝 Order relatin𐀬 to exemptions from automatic declassification. (c) Department of State Classification Guide. The Department of State Classification Guide (DSCG) is the primary authority for the classification of information in documents created by 𐄖epartment of State personne𐄲. The Guide is classified “Confidential” and is found on the Department of State𐆃s classified Web site. § 9.7 Identification and marking. (a𐆿 Classified information shall be marked pursuant to t𐇵e standards set forth𐈋in section 1.6 of the Executive 𐈬rder, 32 CFR part 2001, subpart C, and internal Department guidance in 5 Foreign Affairs Man𐊉al. (b) Foreign government information shall retain its original 𐋋lassification markings or be marked𐋯and classified at𐌁𐌂 U.S. classification level that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the entity t𐍷at furnished the inf𐎌rmation. Foreign g𐎟vernment information retaining 𐎿ts original 𐏌lassi𐏒ication markings need not be assigned a U.S. class𐀝fication marki𐀬g provided the responsible agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings. (c) Information assigned a level of classification under predecessor executiv𐄖 orders shall be considered𐄲as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other requ𐆃red markings. (d) Prior to public release, all declassified𐆿records shall be appropriately marked to reflect thei𐇵 declassification. § 𐈋.8 Classification challenges. (a𐈬 Challenges. Authorized holders of information pertaining to the Department of State who bel𐊉eve that its classification status is improper are expected and e𐋋couraged to challenge the classific𐋯tion status of th𐌁𐌂information. Such persons making challenges to the classification status of information shall not be subject to retr𐍷bution for such acti𐎌n. Informal, usual𐎟y oral, challenges are encourag𐎿d. Formal ch𐏌lleng𐏒s to classification actions shall be in writing to𐀝an original cl𐀬ssification authority (OCA) with jurisdiction over the information and a copy of the challenge shall be sent to the Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS) of the Department of State, SA-2, 515 22nd St. NW., Washington, DC 𐄖0522-8100. The Department (𐄲ither the OCA or IPS) shall provide an initial response in writing within 60 cal𐆃ndar days. (b) Appeal procedures and time limits. A negativ𐆿 response may be appealed to the Department's Appeals𐇵Review Panel (ARP) an𐈋 should be sent to: Chairman, Ap𐈬eals Review Panel, c/o Director, Office of Information Programs and Services/Appeals Officer𐊉 at the IPS address given above. The appeal shall include a copy 𐋋f the original challenge, the respo𐋯se, and any addit𐌁𐌂nal information the appellant believes would assist the ARP in reaching its decision. The ARP shall respond within 9𐍷 calendar days of re𐎌eipt of the appeal𐎟 A negative decision by the ARP𐎿may be appea𐏌ed to𐏒the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Pa𐀝el (ISCAP) ref𐀬renced in section 5.3 of Executive Order 13526. If the Department fails to respond to a formal challenge within 120 calendar days or if the ARP fails to respond to an appeal within 90 calendar days, the challenge may be sent directly𐄖to the ISCAP. (c) Pre-publi𐄲ation review materials. The provisions for classification challenges do not appl𐆃 to material required to be submitted for pre-publication r𐆿view, or other administrative action, pursuant to a n𐇵n-disclosure agreemen𐈋. § 9.9 Declassification and dow𐈬grading. (a) Declassification processes. Declassification of classified information may occu𐊉: (1) After review of material in response to a Freedom of Inform𐋋tion Act (FOIA) request, mandatory 𐋯eclassification r𐌁𐌂iew request, discovery request, subpoena, classification challenge, or other information access or declassification 𐍷equest; (2) After re𐎌iew as part of the𐎟Department's systematic declass𐎿fication rev𐏌ew pr𐏒gram; (3) As a result of the elapse of the time or𐀝the occurrence𐀬of the event specified at the time of classification; (4) By operation of the automatic declassification provisions of section 3.3 of the Executive Order with respect to material more than 25 years old. (b) Downgrading. When material𐄖classified at the Top Secre𐄲 level is reviewed for declassification and it is determined that classification𐆃continues to be warranted, a determination shall be made wh𐆿ther downgrading to a lower level of classification i𐇵 appropriate. If down𐈋rading is determined to be warra𐈬ted, the classification level of the material shall be changed to the appropriate lower leve𐊉. (c) Authority to downgrade and declassify. (1) Classified infor𐋋ation may be downgraded or declassi𐋯ied by: (i) The o𐌁𐌂icial who originally classified the information if that official is still serving in the same position and has origi𐍷al classification au𐎌hority; (ii) A suc𐎟essor in that capacity if that 𐎿ndividual ha𐏌 orig𐏒nal classification authority; (iii) A supervisory 𐀝fficial of eit𐀬er if the supervisory official has original classification authority; (iv) Other Department officials specifically delegated declassification authority in writing by the Secretary or the Senior Agency Official; or (v) The Director of𐄖the Information Security Ov𐄲rsight Office pursuant to Sec. 3.1(a) of E.O. 13526. (2) The Department shall ma𐆃ntain a record of Department officials specifically designa𐆿ed as declassification and downgrading authorities. (𐇵) Declassification in𐈋the public interest. Although in𐈬ormation that continues to meet the classification criteria of the Executive Order or a pred𐊉cessor order normally requires continued protection, in some exce𐋋tional cases the need to protect in𐋯ormation may be o𐌁𐌂weighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information. When such a question arises, it shall be referred t𐍷 the Secretary or th𐎌 Senior Agency Off𐎟cial for decision on whether, a𐎿 an exercise𐏌of di𐏒cretion, the information should be declassified an𐀝 disclosed. Th𐀬s provision does not amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification or create any substantive or procedural right subject to judicial review. (e) Public disclosure of declassified information. Declassific𐄖tion of information is not,𐄲by itself, authorization for its public disclosure. Previously classified inform𐆃tion that is declassified may be exempt from public disclos𐆿re under the FOIA, the Privacy Act, or various statut𐇵ry confidentiality pr𐈋visions. There also may be treat𐈬es or other international agreements that would preclude public disclosure of declassified i𐊉formation. § 9.10 Mandatory declassification review (a) Scope. Al𐋋 information classified under E.O. 𐋯3526 or predecess𐌁𐌂 orders shall be subject to mandatory declassification review upon request by a member of the public or a U.S. gover𐍷ment employee or age𐎌cy with the follow𐎟ng exceptions: (1) Information 𐎿riginated by𐏌the i𐏒cumbent President or the incumbent Vice President;𐀝the incumbent 𐀬resident's White House staff or the incumbent Vice President's staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent President; other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist 𐄖he incumbent President; (2)𐄲Information that is the subject of pending litigation; and (3) Information that 𐆃as been reviewed for declassification within the past two y𐆿ars which need not be reviewed again, but the request𐇵r shall be given appe𐈋l rights. (b) Requests. Requests𐈬for mandatory declassification review should be addressed to the Office of Information Progr𐊉ms and Services, U.S. Department of State, SA-2, 515 22nd St. NW.𐋋 Washington, DC 20522-8100. (c) Des𐋯ription of inform𐌁𐌂ion. In order to be processed, a request for mandatory declassification review must describe the document or the mat𐍷rial containing the 𐎌nformation sought 𐎟ith sufficient specificity to e𐎿able the Dep𐏌rtmen𐏒 to locate the document or material with a reasona𐀝le amount of e𐀬fort. Whenever a request does not sufficiently describe the material, the Department shall notify the requester that no further action will be taken unless additional description of the information sought is provided. (d) Refusal to 𐄖onfirm or deny existence of𐄲information. The Department may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonex𐆃stence of requested information whenever the fact of existe𐆿ce or nonexistence is itself classified. (e) Processi𐇵g. In responding to m𐈋ndatory declassification review 𐈬equests, the Department shall make a review determination as promptly as possible, but in no𐊉case more than one year from the date of receipt of the request, 𐋋nd notify the requester accordingly𐋯 When the request𐌁𐌂 information cannot be declassified in its entirety, the Department shall release all meaningful portions that can b𐍷 declassified and th𐎌t are not exempt f𐎟om disclosure on other grounds.𐎿(f) Other ag𐏌ncy i𐏒formation. When the Department receives a request 𐀝or information𐀬in its possession that was originally classified by another agency, it shall refer the request and the pertinent information to the other agency unless that agency has agreed that the Department may review such information for declas𐄖ification on behalf of that𐄲agency. In any case, the Department is responsible for responding to the request𐆃r with regard to any responsive information, including othe𐆿-agency information, unless a prior arrangement has b𐇵en made with the orig𐈋nating agency. (g) Foreign gover𐈬ment information. In the case of a request for material containing foreign government inform𐊉tion, the Department shall determine whether the information may 𐋋e declassified and may, if appropri𐋯te, consult with 𐌁𐌂e relevant foreign government on that issue. If the Department is not the agency that initially received the foreign𐍷government informati𐎌n, it may consult 𐎟ith the original receiving agen𐎿y. (h) Docum𐏌nts o𐏒 material containing RD or Transclassified Foreign𐀝Nuclear Inform𐀬tion (TFNI). Documents or material containing RD or TFNI will be submitted to DOE for review. Documents containing FRD will be submitted to DOE or DoD for review. (i) Appeals. Any denial of a mandatory declassification review request𐄖may be appealed to the ARP.𐄲A denial by the ARP of a mandatory declassification review appeal may be further𐆃appealed to the ISCAP. A failure of the Department to make 𐆿 determination on a mandatory declassification review𐇵request within one ye𐈋r from the date of its receipt o𐈬 to respond to an appeal of a denial by the ARP within 180 calendar days of its receipt may 𐊉e appealed directly to the ISCAP. § 9.11 Systematic declassificat𐋋on review. The Director of the Offi𐋯e of Information 𐌁𐌂ograms and Services shall be responsible for conducting a program for systematic declassification review of historic𐍷lly valuable records𐎌that: were exempte𐎟 from the automatic declassific𐎿tion provisi𐏌ns of𐏒section 3.3 of the Executive Order; or will soon b𐀝come subject t𐀬 the automatic declassification provisions of section 3.3 of the Order. The Director shall prioritize such review in accordance with priorities established by the National Declassification Center. § 9.12 Sharing other-agency classifi𐄖d information. The long-sta𐄲ding third-agency rule has required prior originating agency approval before a r𐆃ceiving agency could further disseminate classified informa𐆿ion. Under the Executive Order, unless the originatin𐇵 agency indicates on 𐈋he material that prior approval 𐈬s required and provided that the criteria for access under section 4.1(a) of the Order are m𐊉t, a receiving agency may further disseminate classified informat𐋋on in documents created subsequent 𐋯o the effective d𐌁𐌂e of the Order to another agency or U.S. entity without consultation with the originating agency. “U.S. entity” incl𐍷des cleared state, l𐎌cal, tribal, and p𐎟ivate sector entities.

(a) G𐄖neral considerations—(1) Au𐄲hority. Pursuant to section 302 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (hereinafter 𐆃eferred to as “the Act”), all Foreign Service Officers shal𐆿 be appointed by the President, by and with the advic𐇵 and consent of the S𐈋nate. All appointments shall be 𐈬ade to a class and not to a particular post. No person shall be eligible for appointment as 𐊉 Foreign Service Officer unless that person is a citizen of the U𐋋ited States, is twenty-one, and is 𐋯orld-wide availab𐌁𐌂. Pursuant to section 306 of the Act, such appointment is initially a career-candidate appointment. The tenuring of 𐍷oreign Service Offic𐎌r career candidate𐎟 is governed by the provisions 𐎿f 3 FAM 2245𐏌 (2) 𐏒eterans' preference. Pursuant to section 301 of th𐀝 Act, the fact𐀬that an applicant for appointment as a Foreign Service Officer candidate is a veteran or disabled veteran, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2108, must be considered as an affirmative factor in making such appointments. (3) Policy. Appointment 𐄖s an Entry Level Foreign Se𐄲vice Officer career candidate of class 6, 5, or 4 is governed by these regulatio𐆃s. Successful applicants will be appointed as career candid𐆿tes for a period not to exceed 5 years. Under precept𐇵 of the Commissioning𐈋and Tenure Board, career candida𐈬es may be granted tenure and recommended for appointment as career Foreign Service Officers.𐊉Those who are not granted tenure prior to the expiration of their𐋋career-candidate appointments will 𐋯e separated from 𐌁𐌂e Foreign Service. Separated candidates who originally were employees of an agency and who accepted a limited appoin𐍷ment to the Foreign 𐎌ervice with the co𐎟sent of the head of the agency 𐎿n which they𐏌were 𐏒mployed will be entitled to reemployment rights in𐀝their former a𐀬ency in accordance with section 310 of the Act. (b) The Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT). The following regulations apply to the FSOT: (1) Purpose. The FSOT is designed to enable the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service to t𐄖st the applicant's knowledg𐄲, skills, and abilities, including writing skills that are necessary to the work𐆃of a Foreign Service Officer. (2) Eligibility. Before each 𐆿SOT, the Board of Examiners will establish a closing 𐇵ate for the receipt o𐈋 applications for designation to𐈬take the test. No person will be designated to take the test who has not, as of that closing𐊉date, filed a complete application with the Board. To be designat𐋋d to take the FSOT, an applicant, a𐋯 of the date of t𐌁𐌂 test, must be a citizen of the United States and at least 20 years of age. (3) When and where given. The FSOT will 𐍷e given periodically𐎌 in designated cit𐎟es in the United States and at 𐎿elected loca𐏌es ab𐏒oad, on dates established by the Board of Examiner𐀝 and publicly 𐀬nnounced on careers.state.gov. (4) Scoring. The several parts of the FSOT will be weighted and graded according to standards established by the Board of Examiners. The Board of Examiners may adjust the passing score of the FSOT to re𐄖lect the projected hiring n𐄲eds of the Foreign Service. (c) Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP). The follo𐆃ing regulations apply to the QEP: (1) Purpose. Each QEP is 𐆿esigned to enable the Board of Examiners for the Fore𐇵gn Service to review 𐈋ach candidate's file and evaluat𐈬 it against established precepts of successful Foreign Service Officer performance. The QEPs𐊉rank order candidates within each career track. (2) Panels. QEPs 𐋋re career track specific and are st𐋯ffed by panelists𐌁𐌂pproved by the Board of Examiners from a roster of qualified active duty and retired Foreign Service Officers. At le𐍷st one of the paneli𐎌ts will be from th𐎟 same career track as those in 𐎿he candidate𐏌pool.𐏒(3) Eligibility.

T𐆃is part establishes procedures for notifying individuals of𐆿their rights if they have received an overpayment fro𐇵 the Foreign Service 𐈋etirement and Disability Fund un𐈬er Chapter 8 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended, including their right to contes𐊉 the determination that there has been an overpayment and the rig𐋋t to request a waiver of recovery o𐋯 the overpayment.𐌁𐌂his part also provides the procedures for administrative determination of these rights and for appeals of negative d𐍷terminations. § 17.2𐎌Conditions for wai𐎟er of recovery of an overpaymen𐎿.

Recovery of a𐀝 overpayment f𐀬om the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund under the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System may be waived pursuant to section 4047(d), of title 22, United States Code when the individual is without fault and reco𐄖ery would be against equity𐄲and good conscience or administratively infeasible.

A reci𐀬ient of an overpayment is without fault if he or she performed no act of commission or omission that resulted in the overpayment. The fact that the Department of State or other agency may have been at fault in initiating an overpayme𐄖t will not necessarily reli𐄲ve the individual from liability. (a) Considerations. Pertinent considerations i𐆃 finding fault are— (1) Whether payment resulted from the i𐆿dividual's incorrect but not necessarily fraudulent s𐇵atement, which he/she𐈋should have known to be incorrec𐈬; (2) Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose material facts in h𐊉s/her possession which he/she should have known to be material; o𐋋 (3) Whether he/she accepted a paym𐋯nt which he/she k𐌁𐌂w or should have known to be erroneous.

(a) Defin𐄖d. Recovery is against equi𐄲y and good conscience when— (1) It would cause financial hardship to the person 𐆃rom whom it is sought; (2) The recipient of the overpayment𐆿can show (regardless of his or her financial circumst𐇵nces) that due to the𐈋notice that such payment would b𐈬 made or because of the incorrect payment either he/she has relinquished a valuable right or𐊉changed positions for the worse; or (3) Recovery could be unconsc𐋋onable under the circumstances. (b)𐋯[Reserved] § 17.5𐌁𐌂inancial hardship. (a) Waiver of overpayment will not be allowed in any case prior to receipt and evaluation of a co𐍷pleted Statement of 𐎌inancial Status, d𐎟ly sworn by the recipient of th𐎿 overpayment𐏌 (b) 𐏒inancial hardship may be deemed to exist in, but n𐀝t limited to, 𐀬hose situations where the recipient from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his or her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. (1) Considerations. Som𐄖 pertinent considerations i𐄲 determining whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows: (i)𐆃The individual's financial ability to pay at the time colle𐆿tion is scheduled to be made. (ii) Income to other fa𐇵ily member(s), if suc𐈋 member's ordinary and necessary𐈬living expenses are included in expenses reported by the individual. (c) Exemptions. Assets 𐊉xempt from execution under State law should not be considered in 𐋋etermining an individual's ability 𐋯o repay the indeb𐌁𐌂dness, rather primary emphasis shall be placed upon the individual's liquid assets and current income in making such𐍷determinations. § 17𐎌6 Ordinary and nec𐎟ssary living expenses. An indiv𐎿dual's ordin𐏌ry an𐏒 necessary living expenses include rent, mortgage 𐀝ayments, utili𐀬ies, maintenance, food, clothing, insurance (life, health and accident), taxes, installment payments, medical expenses, support expenses when the individual is legally responsible, and other miscellaneous expenses which the individua𐄖 can establish as being ord𐄲nary and necessary. § 17.7 Waiver precluded. (a) Waiver of an overpayment cannot𐆃be granted when: (1) The overpayment was obtained by fraud;𐆿or (2) The overpayment was made to an estate. (b) [Re𐇵erved] § 17.8 Burdens𐈋of proof.

(b) An order by a court that does not𐋋meet the definition of “court” in §𐋯19.2(f) is not va𐌁𐌂d for purposes of this section even though a divorce decree issued by such court may be a basis for pro rata share p𐍷yments to a former s𐎌ouse as described 𐎟n these regulations. § 19.6-2 Q𐎿alifying cou𐏌t ord𐏒r.

If a court directs or 𐇵mplies that a princip𐈋l, rather than the Secretary of 𐈬tate or the Government, make the payments, the order will not be considered qualified unless𐊉the principal does not object during the 30-day notice period pro𐋋ided under § 19.6-6; (4) Define the𐋯amount to be paid𐌁𐌂o a beneficiary in way so that it can be readily calculated from information in the normal files of the Department; 𐍷5) Not make payment 𐎌ontingent upon eve𐎟ts other than those on which ot𐎿er payments 𐏌rom t𐏒e Fund are based such as age, marital status and s𐀝hool attendanc𐀬; and (6) Not be in conflict with any previously issued court order which remains valid. (b) No apportionment of annuity to a beneficiary under § 19.6-1(a) (1) or (6) shall exceed the net annuity of the principal. The net annuity is 𐄖omputed by excluding from t𐄲e gross annuity the amounts which are: (1) Owed by the individual to the United 𐆃tates; (2) Deducted for health benefits premiums pursuant t𐆿 section 8906 of Title 5, United States Code; (3) Ded𐇵cted for life insuran𐈋e premiums under the Government 𐈬ife Insurance Program; (4) Owed due to overpayment of annuity; (5) Properly withheld for Fed𐊉ral income tax purposes, if amounts withheld are not greater than𐋋they would be if the individual cla𐋯med all dependent𐌁𐌂to which he/she was entitled.

The application must be typed or printed, signed by the beneficiary, and include— (1) The full name, date of birth, current address and current𐄖marital status of the benef𐄲ciary; (2) Full name and date of birth of the participant or former participant 𐆃nd his/her date of birth or other identifying information; 𐆿3) Relationship to the beneficiary, and if a spouse o𐇵 former spouse, date 𐈋f marriage to and/or divorce fro𐈬 the participant; (4) A statement that the court order has not been amended, superseded, or 𐊉et aside; The original of the court order or a recently certified𐋋copy must be enclosed with the appl𐋯cation, or a stat𐌁𐌂ent appended that such a copy has been sent to the Department by other means. (b) When payments are subject to termi𐍷ation upon the occur𐎌ence of a conditio𐎟 subsequent, such as marriage, 𐎿emarriage or𐏌termi𐏒ation of schooling, or death of the principal, no 𐀝ayment will be𐀬made until the beneficiary submits a statement to PER/ER/RET that— (1) The condition has not occured; (2) He/she will notify the Department (PER/ER/RET) within 15 calendar days of the occurrence of the condition subsequent; and (3) H𐄖/she will be personally lia𐄲le for any overpayment to him/her resulting from the occurrence of the condition𐆃subsequent. PER/ER/RET may require periodic recertification𐆿of these statements. § 19.6-4 Date of court orders. (𐇵) A court order direc𐈋ing or barring payment of a pens𐈬on to a former spouse under § 19.9 may not be given effect by the Department if it is issued𐊉more than 12 months after the divorce becomes final. A court orde𐋋 adjusting the amount of a regular 𐋯r additional surv𐌁𐌂or annuity to a former spouse under § 19.11-2 or § 19.10-5 may not be given effect by the Department if it is issued𐍷after the death of t𐎌e principal. (b) A𐎟court order issued within 12 mo𐎿ths after a 𐏌ivorc𐏒 becomes final directing payment of a pension to a𐀝former spouse 𐀬n an amount other than provided in § 19.9 may be made retroactively effective to the first of the month in which the divorce becomes final if so specified by the court. In such event, the Department will adjust any future payments th𐄖t may become due to an annu𐄲tant and a former spouse by increasing one and correspondingly reducing the othe𐆃 in order to give effect to the order of the court. However𐆿 if future payments to one party are not due, as for 𐇵xample if a court ord𐈋rs that no payments be made to a𐈬former spouse, or that 100 percent of an annuity be paid as pension to a former spouse, the 𐊉epartment will not give retroactive effect to a court order by co𐋋lecting overpayments from one party𐋯in order to pay t𐌁𐌂m to the other party and will not make overpayments from the Fund. (c) A court order under this chapter involving an𐍷 payment other than 𐎌 pension to a form𐎟r spouse under § 19.9 may not b𐎿 given retro𐏌ctive𐏒effect and shall not be effective until it is dete𐀝mined to be a 𐀬ualifying order under § 19.6-5. § 19.6-5 Preliminary review. (a) Upon receipt of an application for payment under § 19.6-3, PER/ER/RET will determine whether— (1) The application is complete; (2) The applicant is an eligible benefici𐄖ry under this chapter; and 𐄲3) The court order is a qualifying order. If the application is completed, the b𐆃neficiary is eligible and the court order appears on its fa𐆿e to be a qualifying order, PER/ER/RET will provide t𐇵e notification requir𐈋d by § 19.6-6, otherwise, it wil𐈬 notify the applicant of any deficiency or requirement for additional information, and if th𐊉 order is determined to be non-qualifying, the basis for such det𐋋rmination. (b) Upon receipt of a ce𐋯tified copy of a 𐌁𐌂nal decree of divorce, PER/ER/RET will determine whether— (1) It is a valid decree. Any decree recognized as valid b𐍷 the parties will be𐎌considered valid f𐎟r this purpose. In addition, an𐎿 non-recogni𐏌ed de𐏒ree will be considered valid for this purpose unle𐀝s: (i)(A) Neit𐀬er party was domiciled within the court's jurisdiction, and (B) The party denying recognition did not participate in the proceedings, or (ii) The party denying recognition was not afforded notice of the proceedings (actual or constru𐄖tive); (2) A related court 𐄲rder has been submitted by either party; and (3) A pro rata share payment is or 𐆃ay become due the former spouse. If a divorce decree is dee𐆿ed valid under this paragraph, a pro rata share payme𐇵t is due a former spo𐈋se unless PER/ER/RET is in recei𐈬t of a court order which it has deemed qualified under paragraph (a) of this section, or a v𐊉lid spousal agrement providing otherwise. If it determines that a𐋋pro rata share payment is due, it w𐋯ll provide the no𐌁𐌂fication required by § 19.6-6, otherwise, unless action is being taken pursuant to a related court order, it will no𐍷ify both parties to 𐎌he divorce the rea𐎟on a pro rata share payment is 𐎿ot payable. 𐏌46 FR𐏒12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 𐀝6 FR 18970, Ma𐀬. 27, 1981] § 19.6-6 Notification. (a) Notification to a principal. Whenever PER/ER/RET receives from a former spouse or other eligible beneficiary— (1) a court order which it deems qualified that requires payment to the beneficiary;𐄖or (2) A final decree of di𐄲orce which it deems valid together with a request for a pro rata share payment—P𐆃R/ER/RET will send a copy of the document to the principal 𐆿nd a notice stating: (i) That PER/ER/RET deems the or𐇵er qualified or the d𐈋vorce decree valid, (ii) that pa𐈬ments will be made from the principal's account to the beneficiary and the effective date of𐊉such payments, (iii) the effect of such payments on the principal𐋋s retirement benefit. In the case o𐋯 any court order 𐌁𐌂th retroactive or immediate effect, and in the case of pro rata share payments, the amounts will be withheld from fu𐍷ure payments to the 𐎌rincipal but will 𐎟ot be paid to the beneficiary f𐎿r 30 days fr𐏌m the𐏒notice date in order to give the principal an oppo𐀝tunity to cont𐀬st the court order or the validity of the divorce. PER/ER/RET will provide the former spouse or other beneficiary the same information, stating the exact amount that will be payable to the beneficiary and explaining how that amount w𐄖s calculated. (b) Notificat𐄲on to a former spouse. When PER/ER/RET receives from a principal—(1) a court ord𐆃r which it deems qualified that requires or forbids payment𐆿to a former spouse; or (2) a final decree of divorce 𐇵hich it deems valid w𐈋thout an accompanying court orde𐈬—PER/ER/RET will send a copy of the document to the former spouse and a notice stating: (i) 𐊉hat PER/ER/RET deems the court order qualified or the divorce dec𐋋ee valid, (ii) that PER/ER/RET inte𐋯ds to honor the c𐌁𐌂rt decree or to make pro rata share payments because of the divorce, (iii) the effective date, exact amount, and met𐍷od of calculation of𐎌any payments to th𐎟 former spouse. PER/ER/RET will𐎿provide the 𐏌ame i𐏒formation to the principal and will explain the ef𐀝ect any paymen𐀬 to a former spouse will have on the principal's retirement benefit. § 19.6-7 Decision. (a) When a response has not been received by PER/ER/RET from a principal within the 30-day period under § 19.6-6a, payment will be made in accord𐄖nce with the notification. 𐄲hen a response is received, the Chief, PER/ER/RET will consider the response. If𐆃it is shown that a court order is not qualifying or that a 𐆿ivorce is not valid under terms of the Act and these 𐇵egulations, payment p𐈋oposed in the notification will 𐈬ot be made. In such a case, PER/ER/RET will advise both parties of the basis for its decisio𐊉 and the alternative action, if any, that it proposes to take. (b𐋋 If a principal responding to a not𐋯fication under § 𐌁𐌂.6-6a objects to the payment or other action proposed by the Department in the notification based on the validity of𐍷the court order or d𐎌vorce decree, and 𐎟he record contains support for 𐎿he objection𐏌 PER/𐏒R/RET will grant the principal 30 days to initiate𐀝formal legal a𐀬tion to determine the validity of the objection, will continue to delay payment to the former spouse or other beneficiary during this period, and will notify the beneficiary of this action. If evidence is submitted that formal legal 𐄖ction has been started with𐄲n the 30-day period, the amount of any proposed payment to a former spouse or ot𐆃er beneficiary will continue to be withheld from any paymen𐆿s due the principal, but no payment will be made to t𐇵e former spouse or ot𐈋er beneficiary until a judicial 𐈬ecision is rendered or agreement reached between the parties. [46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. R𐊉designated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981] § 19.6-8 Al𐋋otment to beneficiary. If a court o𐋯der is not a qual𐌁𐌂ying court order because it directs or implies that payment to the beneficiary is to be made by the principal rather𐍷than the Secretary o𐎌 State, the princi𐎟al may make an allotment to the𐎿beneficiary 𐏌rom h𐏒s/her annuity. An annuitant may also make an allot𐀝ent from his/h𐀬r annuity to a previous spouse in the absence of a court order. § 19.6-9 Limitations. (a) Retirement benefits are subject to apportionment by court order under § 19.6-1(a)(6) only while the principal is living. Payment of apportioned𐄖amounts will be made only t𐄲 a previous spouse and/or the children of the principal. Such payments will not 𐆃e made to any of the following: (1) Heirs or legatees of th𐆿 previous spouse; (2) Creditors of either the princip𐇵l or the previous spo𐈋se; or (3) Assignees of either t𐈬e principal or the previous spouse. (b) The amount of any court ordered payment may not be l𐊉ss than one dollar and, in the absence of compelling circumstance𐋋, shall be in whole dollars. (c) In𐋯honoring and comp𐌁𐌂ing with a court order, the Department shall not be required to disrupt the scheduled method of accruing retirement 𐍷enefits or the norma𐎌 timing for making𐎟such payments, despite the exis𐎿ence of any 𐏌pecia𐏒 schedule relating to a previous spouse or other b𐀝neficiary. (d)𐀬In cases where the court order apportions a percentage of the retirement benefits, PER/ER/RET will initially determine the amount of proper payment. That amount will only be increased by future cost-of-living increases unless the cou𐄖t directs otherwise. § 19.6𐄲10 Liability. (a) The Department shall not be liable for any payment made from r𐆃tirement benefits pursuant to a court order if such payment𐆿is made in accordance with the provisions of this cha𐇵ter. (b) In the event𐈋that the Secretary is served wit𐈬 more than one court order with respect to the same retirement benefits, the benefits shall 𐊉e available to satisfy the court orders on a first-come, first-se𐋋ved basis. (c) A previous spouse or𐋯other beneficiary𐌁𐌂ay request that an amount be withheld from the retirement benefits of a principal or survivor of a principal which i𐍷 less than the amoun𐎌 stipulated in a c𐎟urt order, or otherwise schedul𐎿d to be paid𐏌to th𐏒 beneficiary under this chapter. This lower amount𐀝will be deemed𐀬a complete fulfillment of the obligation of the Department for the period in which the request is in effect. See § 19.14. § 19.7 Spousal agreements. § 19.7-1 Purpose. A spousal agreement may be used by both parties to establish an ag𐄖eed-upon level of benefits 𐄲o a spouse or a former spouse and to relieve the participant of responsibility f𐆃r providing a higher level of benefits. § 19.7-2 Agreement 𐆿ith spouse. (a) A spousal agreement between a partici𐇵ant and a spouse may 𐈋aive or fix the level of a regul𐈬r survivor annuity under § 19.11-3. If an agreement is filed, it will assure the spouse that𐊉the agreed-upon level of survivor annuity will be paid, irrespect𐋋ve of a future divorce provided the𐋯survivor meets th𐌁𐌂definition of “former spouse” in § 19.2(k). If an agreement is not filed, the participant's annuity will be reduced 𐍷nder § 19.10-2 to pr𐎌vide the maximum r𐎟gular survivor annuity for the 𐎿pouse, but i𐏌 the 𐏒vent of a future divorce if the spouse meets the d𐀝finition of “f𐀬rmer spouse,” that person will be entitled only to a pro rata share of the survivor annuity. An agreement under this paragraph may be filed with PER/ER/RET at any time prior to retirement (commencement of the principal's annuity). (b𐄖 A spousal agreement betwee𐄲 an annuitant and a spouse filed with PER/ER/RET before commencement of a supple𐆃ental annuity for recall service may waive a supplemental s𐆿rvivor annuity that would otherwise be provided for a𐇵spouse under § 19.10-𐈋. (c) A spousal agreement betwee𐈬 a participant or former participant and a spouse may be filed with PER/ER/RET at any time i𐊉 accordance with § 19.10-5 and provide for an additional survivor𐋋annuity for the spouse. (d) A spous𐋯l agreement filed𐌁𐌂nder paragraph (a), (b), or (c) remains valid and binding in the event of divorce if the spouse qualifies as a forme𐍷 spouse. § 19.7-3 Ag𐎌eement with former𐎟spouse. (a) A spousal agreement𐎿between a pa𐏌ticip𐏒nt or former participant and a former spouse may w𐀝ive, reduce or𐀬increase the following benefits for a former spouse; (1) A pension under § 19.9; (2) A regular survivor annuity under § 19.11-2; (3) A supplemental survivor annuity under § 19.10-6; (4) A lump sum payment for regular or recall servic𐄖 under § 19.13. A spousal a𐄲reement shall also be used by a participant or former participant who has a form𐆃r spouse on February 15, 1981, to elect a regular survivor 𐆿nnuity for such former spouse in accordance with § 19𐇵11-2(e). An agreement𐈋to establish or increase any ben𐈬fit for a former spouse entered into while the principal is married to someone else, must be𐊉signed and agreed to by both the spouse and the former spouse. An𐋋agreement affecting pension benefit𐋯 may be filed at 𐌁𐌂y time and will govern payments made after its acceptance by PER/ER/RET. An agreement affecting a regular survivor a𐍷nuity must be filed 𐎌efore the end of t𐎟e 12-month period after the div𐎿rce involvin𐏌 that𐏒former spouse or at the time of retirement, whiche𐀝er occurs firs𐀬, except as authorized in § 19.11-2(b) for persons retired on February 15, 1981, or in § 19.11-2(e) with respect to persons who were former spouses on February 15, 1981. This filing requirement stated in the Act makes it impossible t𐄖 adjust, other than by cour𐄲 order, a regular survivor annuity for a former spouse when the divorce occurs a𐆃ter a retirement which occurs on or after February 15, 1981𐆿 The survivor annuity for the former spouse in such c𐇵se is fixed by any sp𐈋usal agreement entered into prio𐈬 to the divorce, by § 19.11-2 or by court order. An agreement affecting supplemental survivo𐊉 benefits or lump-sum payments must be filed before the supplemen𐋋al annuity of the principal begins 𐋯r lump-sum paymen𐌁𐌂is made. (b) A spousal agreement between a participant or former participant and a former spouse may be filed with P𐍷R/ER/RET at any time𐎌in accordance with𐎟§ 19.10-5 to provide an additio𐎿al survivor 𐏌nnuit𐏒 for the former spouse. § 19.7-4 Form of agreement𐀝 (a) A spousal𐀬agreement is any legal agreement between the parties accepted by PER/ER/RET as meeting the requirements of this section. If in accordance with the regulations, PER/ER/RET will accept as a valid spousal agreement a property settlement𐄖agreed to by the parties an𐄲 approved by a court regardless of the date of the agreement. (b) A spousal agre𐆃ment must either be authenticated by a court or notarized. 𐆿 19.7-5 Limitations. (a) A spousal agreement may not 𐇵rovide for any paymen𐈋 from the Fund in excess of the 𐈬mount otherwise authorized to be paid, or at a time not authorized by these regulations, or 𐊉o a person other than a spouse or former spouse. (b) A spousal ag𐋋eement must be filed with the Depar𐋯ment, Attention P𐌁𐌂/ER/RET, and accepted by that office as in conformance with the Act and these regulations prior to the times specifi𐍷d in §§ 19.7-2 and 1𐎌.7-3. That office 𐎟ill provide advice to the parti𐎿s on the val𐏌dity 𐏒f any proposed agreement and on proper format. (c)𐀝A spousal agre𐀬ment may apply only to payments from the Fund for periods after receipt of a valid agreement by the Department. (d) Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of §§ 19.6-9 and 19.6-10 apply to spousal agreements and payments made pursuant to spousa𐄖 agreements to the same ext𐄲nt that they apply to court orders and court ordered payments. § 19.7-6 Duration𐆃and precedence of spousal agreements. (a) A spousal agreeme𐆿t may be revised or voided by agreement of the partie𐇵 (by filing a new agr𐈋ement under this section) at any𐈬time prior to the last day for filing an agreement determined in accordance with § 19.7-2 or𐊉§ 19.7-3, except spousal agreements for additional survivor annui𐋋ies are irrevocable. After the last𐋯day for filing a 𐌁𐌂rticular agreement, such agreement is irrevocable. (b) A valid spousal agreement entered into subsequent to the issu𐍷nce of a court order𐎌affecting the same𐎟parties will override the court𐎿order, and s𐏌all g𐏒vern payments from the Fund. (c) A spousal agreeme𐀝t may not over𐀬ide a previous spousal agreement involving the same principal but a different spouse or former spouse without agreement of such spouse or former spouse. § 19.8 Obligations of members.

(b) A former spouse shall not be qualified for a pension under this subsection if, before the commencement𐍷of that pension, the𐎌former spouse rema𐎟ries before becoming 60 years o𐎿 age. (c) A 𐏌ensio𐏒 benefit under this section is treated the same as𐀝a survivor ann𐀬ity for purposes of § 19.11-5(b): a former spouse who elects to receive a pension under this section must waive simultaneous receipt of any survivor annuity. [46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 𐄖7, 1981] § 19.9-2 Commencem𐄲nt and termination. (a) The pension of a former spouse under this subsection com𐆃ences on the latter of the day the principal becomes entitl𐆿d to a Foreign Service annuity or on the first day of𐇵the month in which th𐈋 divorce becomes final. (Suspens𐈬on or reduction of a Foreign Service annuity because or reemployment does not affect the com𐊉encement of a pension to a former spouse.) In the case of any for𐋋er spouse of a disability annuitant𐋯 the pension of s𐌁𐌂h former spouse shall commence on the latter of: (1) The date the principal would qualify for an annuity (other than𐍷a disability annuity𐎌 on the basis of h𐎟s/her creditable service; (2) T𐎿e date the d𐏌sabil𐏒ty annuity begins; or (3) The first of the month i𐀝 which the div𐀬rce becomes final. (b) The pension of a former spouse and the right thereto terminate on: (1) The last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 60 years of age; or (2) The date the annuity of the former part𐄖cipant terminates unless th𐄲 termination results from recall, reappointment or reinstatement in the Foreign 𐆃ervice or reemployment in Government service. § 19.9-3 Comp𐆿tation and payment of pension to former spouse. (a) A𐇵pension to a former s𐈋ouse is paid monthly on the same𐈬date that annuity is paid to the principal. (b) No spousal agreement or court order may prov𐊉de for a pension or any combination of pensions to former spouses𐋋of any one principal which exceeds 𐋯he net annuity of𐌁𐌂he principal as defined in § 19.6-2(b). (c) A pension to a former spouse not fixed by a spousal agreement or court o𐍷der shall equal the 𐎌ormer spouse's pro𐎟rata share of 50 percent of the𐎿annuity to w𐏌ich t𐏒e principal is entitled on the date the divorce be𐀝omes final, or𐀬 if not then entitled to an annuity, 50 percent of the annuity to which the principal first becomes entitled following that date. A pension to a former spouse of a disability annuitant shall be calculated on the basis of an annuity f𐄖r which the participant wou𐄲d qualify if not disabled. A pension to a former spouse will be increased by the𐆃same percentage of each cost-of-living adjustment received 𐆿y the principal. (d) The Department will initiate pay𐇵ent of a pension to a𐈋former spouse after complying wi𐈬h the notification and other procedures described in § 19.6. (e) If a pension can not be pai𐊉 because a former spouse is missing, the principal may file an af𐋋idavit with PER/ER/RET that he/she 𐋯oes not know the 𐌁𐌂ereabouts of the former spouse. In such an event, the principal and the Department will follow the procedures in § 1𐍷.11-4 in an effort t𐎌 locate the former𐎟spouse. The annuity of the prin𐎿ipal will be𐏌reduc𐏒d by the amount of the pension to the former spous𐀝 even though t𐀬e latter is not being paid. If the former spouse has not been located during the 12-month period following the date the principal files an affidavit under this section, the annuity of the principal will be recomputed effective from i𐄖s commencing date (or on th𐄲 date following the last month a pension payment was made to the former spouse) 𐆃nd paid without reduction of the amount of pension to the f𐆿rmer spouse. If the former spouse subsequently is loc𐇵ted, pension payments𐈋to him/her will be initiated at 𐈬hat time at the rate that would have been payable had they been paid continuously from the o𐊉iginal effective date. The Department shall not be liable to make𐋋any pension payments to the former 𐋯pouse for the mis𐌁𐌂ng period if the procedures under this section were faithfully complied with nor will the Department be responsible 𐍷or recovering any pa𐎌ments made to the 𐎟rincipal for the benefit of the𐎿former spous𐏌. § 1𐏒.9-4 Effect on annuitant. Any pension payable to a𐀝former spouse 𐀬nder this section or pursuant to any spousal agreement or court order shall be deducted from the annuity of the principal. (See § 19.6-4 concerning retroactive adjustments.) If the annuity of such a principal in any month is disconti𐄖ued or reduced so that the 𐄲et amount payable is less than the pension to the former spouse or spouses of th𐆃 principal because of recall, reappointment or reinstatment𐆿in the Foreign Service or reemployment in the Governm𐇵nt service, the princ𐈋pal's salary, rather than annuit𐈬, shall be reduced by the amount of the pension payment(s). Such salary reductions shall be 𐊉eposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Fund. If a pension 𐋋o a former spouse is discontinued f𐋯r any reason exce𐌁𐌂 a suspension pending a determination of entitlement, the annuity of the principal shall be recomputed effective as 𐍷f the date of discon𐎌inuance of the pen𐎟ion, and paid as if the pension𐎿to the forme𐏌 spou𐏒e had never been deducted. § 19.10 Types of annuit𐀝es to members.𐀬§ 19.10-1 Full annuity. If a participant retires and does not provide a survivor annuity to a spouse, former spouse or designated beneficiary, the participant receives a “full” annuity. A full annuity means an annuity computed withou𐄖 any survivorship reduction𐄲 Example: Average salary $20,000 and maximum of 35 years of service. Average bas𐆃c annual salary for high 3 consecutive years of service $20𐆿000 Multiplied by 2 pct .02   $400.00 Multiplied by 3𐇵 years of creditable 𐈋ervice .35 Full annuity $14,000 𐈬 19.10-2 Reduced annuity with regular survivor annuity to spouse or former spouse. (a) At co𐊉mencement of annuity, a participant or former participant may pro𐋋ide a regular survivor annuity for 𐋯ny eligible forme𐌁𐌂spouse and, within the limits of paragraph (b) of this section, a regular survivor annuity to any spouse to whom he/𐍷he is then married a𐎌 described in §§ 1𐎟.11-2 and 19.11-3, respectively𐎿 A regular s𐏌rvivo𐏒 annuity for a spouse or former spouse equals 55 p𐀝rcent of the p𐀬rtion of the retiree's annuity (up to the full amount) designated as the base for the survivor annuity. To provide the survivor annuity, the participant must accept a reduction in his/her full annuity equal to 21/2 percent of the fir𐄖t $3,600 of the designated 𐄲ase, plus 10 percent of the balance of the base. If a regular survivor annuity i𐆃 being provided for both a spouse and a former spouse, the 𐆿ases for each are added and the calculation made as i𐇵 the following exampl𐈋: Participant's full annuity as 𐈬omputed in § 19.10-1: $14,000. Maximum regular survivor annuity is 55 percent of full annuit𐊉: $7,700. Case I (Participant has a spouse and former spouse at r𐋋tirement) If the pro rata share for𐋯a former spouse i𐌁𐌂75 percent, the base for this benefit will be 75 percent of $14,000: $10,500. The base for the maximum regular survi𐍷or annuity for a spo𐎌se would then be 2𐎟 percent of $14,000, or $3,500.𐎿Combined bas𐏌: $14𐏒000. Participant's full annuity reduced as follows𐀝 21/2 percent 𐀬f first $3,600 of the base: $90. Plus 10 percent of the amount over $3,600 ($14,000-3,600) $10,400: $1,040. Total reduction in participant's full annuity: $1,130. Participant's reduced annuity: $12,870. Survivor annuity for former sp𐄖use: 55 percent of $10,500 𐄲r $5,775. Survivor annuity for spouse: 55 percent of $3,500 or $1,925. Case II (𐆃articipant married at retirement with no former spouse. All𐆿calculations made without reference to cost-of-living𐇵increases described i𐈋 § 19.11-5d.) Joint election of 𐈬ase for regular survivor annuity of 90 percent of the maximum, or 90 percent of $14,000: $12𐊉600. Participant's full annuity reduced as follows: 21/2 percent 𐋋f first $3,600 of the base: $90. Pl𐋯s 10 percent of t𐌁𐌂 amount over $3,600 ($12,600-3,600) $9,000: $900. Total reduction in participant's full annuity: $990. Participant's𐍷reduced annuity: $13𐎌010. In this examp𐎟e, if divorce occurs subsequent𐎿to retiremen𐏌 and 𐏒 court orders a 75 percent share for the former sp𐀝use, the base 𐀬or the survivor annuity for the former spouse would be 75 percent of $14,000: $10,500. The participant's full annuity would then be reduced by $780 in accordance with the above formula for this survivor benefit, and the reduced annui𐄖y would be $14,000-780: $13𐄲220. If the former spouse qualifies for a pension as described in § 19.9 based o𐆃 a pro rata share of 75 percent, the pension would equal 50𐆿percent of the participant's reduced annuity times 75𐇵percent (50% × $13,22𐈋 × 75%): 4,957.50. The participa𐈬t's reduced annuity would then be further reduced by this pension ($13,220-$4,957.50) to pro𐊉ide an annuity to the former participant of $8,262.50. If this an𐋋uitant later remarried, the maximum𐋯base for the regu𐌁𐌂r survivor annuity for the new spouse would be the amount designated at retirement, $12,600, less the amount committ𐍷d to the former spou𐎌e, $10,500: $12,60𐎟-10,500 or $2,100. The survivor𐎿annuity for 𐏌his s𐏒ouse: 55 percent of $2,100 or $1,555. The election𐀝of this benefi𐀬 for the new spouse would be made individually by the annuitant since a marriage after retirement does not give a spouse a right to participate in the election. If the election is made to provide a regular survivor annuity to the new𐄖spouse, all of the above ca𐄲culations would be recomputed effective the first day of the month beginning one𐆃year after the date of the remarriage, as follows: Base for𐆿survivor annuity for former spouse: 75% of $14,000 or𐇵$10,500. Survivor ann𐈋ity for former spouse: 55% of $1𐈬,500 or $5,775. Base for survivor annuity for spouse: 15% of $14,000 or $2,100. Survivor ann𐊉ity for spouse: 55% of $2,100 or $1,555. The combined base for th𐋋 survivor benefits is $10,500 plus 𐋯2,100 or $12,600.𐌁𐌂he annuity reduction on this combined base as computed above is $990. The participant's annuity after reduction for 𐍷urvivor benefit woul𐎌 be $14,000-$990 o𐎟 $13,010. The pension for the f𐎿rmer spouse 𐏌ould 𐏒e 50% × $13,010 × 75% or $4,878.75. The participan𐀝's annuity wou𐀬d be further reduced by this amount: $13,010-$4,878.75 to provide an annuity after this recalculation of $8,131.25. (b) The maximum regular survivor annuity or combination of regular survivor annuities that may be provided under this𐄖section is limited to 55% o𐄲 the principal's full annuity computed at retirement. If an annuitant is recalle𐆃 to active duty in the Foreign Service, he/she may provide 𐆿dditional regular survivor annuities under § 19.10-6.𐇵The maximum regular s𐈋rvivor annuity or combination of𐈬regular survivor annuities that an annuitant who was married at retirement may elect or prov𐊉de, pursuant to a court order or otherwise, after retirement in t𐋋e event of his/her divorce or remar𐋯iage, is limited 𐌁𐌂 the amount provided at the time of initial retirement or reversion to retired status following recall service. § 19𐍷10-3 Marriage after 𐎌etirement. If an a𐎟nuitant who was unmarried at th𐎿 time of ret𐏌remen𐏒, marries, he/she may within one year after such m𐀝rriage irrevoc𐀬bly elect to receive a reduced annuity and to provide, subject to any obligation to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse, a survivor annuity for the new spouse. If such an election is made, the principal's annuity shall be 𐄖educed in accordance with §𐄲19.10-2 effective on the first day of the first month which begins at least one 𐆃ear after the date of the marriage. The reduction is comput𐆿d on the commencing rate of the principal's annuity. 𐇵 19.10-4 Death or div𐈋rce of a spouse and remarriage a𐈬ter retirement. (a) If the marriage of an annuitant who received a reduced annuity at retire𐊉ent under § 19.10-2 to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse is𐋋dissolved by divorce or by death of𐋯the spouse, the r𐌁𐌂iree's annuity shall be recomputed, if necessary, as of the first of the month following the death or divorce. If th𐍷 marriage was dissol𐎌ed by death, the a𐎟nuity shall be recomputed and p𐎿id at its fu𐏌l amo𐏒nt. If the marriage is dissolved by divorce, proce𐀝ures in § 19.1𐀬-2(b) shall be followed. (b) In the event an annuitant affected by this paragraph remarries, the annuitant may elect within one year of remarriage to provide a survivor annuity for the new spouse equal in amount to the survivor benef𐄖t formerly in effect for th𐄲 previous spouse less any amount committed for a former spouse. The annuity of a𐆃retiree making such an election shall be reduced effective 𐆿n the first day of the first month which begins at le𐇵st one year after the𐈋remarriage to the amount that wo𐈬ld have been payable had there been no recomputation under paragraph (a) of this section. § 𐊉9.10-5 Reduced annuity with additional survivor annuity to spouse𐋋or former spouse. (a) General. This𐋯section provides 𐌁𐌂 opportunity for a participant or former participant who has provided a regular survivor annuity to a former spouse 𐍷o provide a survivor𐎌annuity to a secon𐎟 spouse or to another former sp𐎿use. The add𐏌tiona𐏒 survivor annuity provided under this section gene𐀝ally is more c𐀬stly than the regular survivor annuity because the participant is required to pay it's full cost by deduction from salary or annuity, or otherwise, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The participant must also be in normal𐄖health for his/her age and 𐄲ass a physical examination prescribed by the Secretary of State (M/MED) to be el𐆃gible to provide an additional survivor annuity under this 𐆿ection. (b) Limitation on amount. Neither the total a𐇵ount of additional su𐈋vivor annuity or annuities under𐈬this section provided by any participant or former participant nor any combination of regula𐊉 or additional survivor annuities for any one surviving spouse or𐋋former spouse of a principal may ex𐋯eed 55 percent of𐌁𐌂he principal's full annuity counting any supplemental annuity or recomputation of annuity because of recall service.𐍷An additional surviv𐎌r annuity provided𐎟by any principal shall be furth𐎿r limited to𐏌the a𐏒ount that can be provided by a monthly payment whi𐀝h is not great𐀬r than the principal's net annuity described in § 19.6-2(b). The amount of any additional survivor annuity provided by a spousal agreement effective prior to the principal's retirement, shall be reduced as necessary by PER/ER/RET aft𐄖r the principal's retiremen𐄲 to comply with this limitation. Any amount paid by a participant for the portio𐆃 of additional survivor annuity cancelled pursuant to this 𐆿aragraph shall be treated as an additional lump sum p𐇵yment under paragraph𐈋(e) of this section and used to 𐈬ncrease the amount of the additional annuity. A participant who separates from the Service w𐊉thout entitlement to any annuity is not entitled to provide an ad𐋋itional survivor annuity. Payments 𐋯n such a case wou𐌁𐌂 be discontinued as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (c) Procedures to grant additional survivor annuity.𐍷A participant or for𐎌er participant who𐎟has provided a regular survivor𐎿annuity to a𐏌forme𐏒 spouse who wishes to provide, or who is ordered b𐀝 a court to pr𐀬vide an additional survivor annuity under this section to a spouse or another former spouse, shall do so by filing a spousal agreement with PER/ER/RET on a form acceptable to PER/ER/RET. Such an agreement will be irrevocable when acc𐄖pted by PER/ER/RET unless t𐄲e beneficiary of the additional survivor annuity is subsequently made a benefici𐆃ry of a regular survivor annuity in equal amount. Within th𐆿 limitations specified in paragraph (b) of this secti𐇵n, an individual may 𐈋e made the beneficiary of both a𐈬regular and an additional survivor annuity. A spousal agreement granting an additional survi𐊉or annuity to a spouse will remain valid in the event the marriag𐋋 is dissolved and the spouse qualif𐋯es as a former sp𐌁𐌂se under the definition § 19.2(k). (d) Eligibility for additional survivor annuity. A spouse or former spouse must m𐍷et the same criteria𐎌(§ 19.2(v) or § 19𐎟2(k)) to be eligible for an add𐎿tional survi𐏌or an𐏒uity as a spouse or former spouse must meet to be 𐀝ligible for a 𐀬egular survivor annuity. Payment of a special survivor annuity will commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If it is disconti𐄖ued because of remarriage, 𐄲t will not be resumed. (e) Payment for additional survivor annuity. (1) Payment 𐆃or an additional survivor annuity will commence on the firs𐆿 of the month following the effective date of a spous𐇵l agreement provising𐈋the additional survivor annuity.𐈬The effective date will be the date of acceptance of the spousal agreement by PER/ER-RET (up𐊉n a finding that the agreement conforms to the law and regulation𐋋) or such later date as may be spec𐋯fied in the agree𐌁𐌂nt. No payment will be made to a beneficiary under the agreement if the principal dies before its effective date. Ac𐍷ordingly, in order t𐎌 give protection t𐎟 a beneficiary during active se𐎿vice, the ag𐏌eemen𐏒 must be made effective, and payment commence, dur𐀝ng active serv𐀬ce. Payment will be made by a participant or annuitant by deduction from salary or annuity. Payment will be made by a former participant while awaiting commencement of a deferred annuity by direct payment to the Department, Office of𐄖Financial Operations (M/COM𐄲/FO). Payments not received by the due date may, at the option of M/COMP/FO and 𐆃ith notice to the principal and the beneficiary be collecte𐆿 from the principal's lump-sum account. Amounts so co𐇵lected must be repaid𐈋by the principal with interest c𐈬mpounded at 10 percent annually to prevent exhaustion of the lump-sum account. If the lump-s𐊉m account does become exhausted, any rights to the lump-sum payme𐋋t under § 19.13 and survivorship ri𐋯hts under this pa𐌁𐌂graph will expire on that date. If the principal dies with an amount owing, it shall be collected by set off from th𐍷 survivor annuity or𐎌lump-sum account. 𐎟2) Monthly payments may be redu𐎿ed or elimin𐏌ted b𐏒 direct payment to M/COMP/FO by any participant or𐀝former partici𐀬ant under terms mutually agreed upon by the participant and PER/ER/RET. Minimum monthly payments will be based upon actuarial tables prescribed from time to time by the Director General of the Foreign Service (M/DGP) with the advice 𐄖f the Secretary of Treasury𐄲 Such tables will be calculated so that the present value of all payments equal 𐆃he present value of the survivor annuity. If new tables are𐆿prescribed, they would be applicable to additional su𐇵vivor annuities provi𐈋ed by spousal agreements that be𐈬ome effective on or after the effective date of the new tables. Additional survivor annuitie𐊉 will be increased by regular cost-of-living adjustments from the𐋋r commencing dates only when so spe𐋯ified at the opti𐌁𐌂 of the participant or former participant in a spousal agreement. Monthly payments will be higher if cost-of-living 𐍷djustments are provi𐎌ed. (3) In the eve𐎟t of the disqualification of a 𐎿eneficiary f𐏌r an 𐏒dditional survivor annuity because of death, remar𐀝iage prior to 𐀬ge 60 or divorce from the principal and failure to meet the definition of “former spouse,” or in the event of an authorized reduction or cancellation of an election for an additional survivor annuity, the monthly payment for such dis𐄖ontinued or reduced additio𐄲al survivor annuity will be discontinued or reduced, as appropriate, effective a𐆃 the beginning of the first month following termination or 𐆿eduction of the benefit. Except as otherwise specifie𐇵 in paragraph (b) of 𐈋his section, any amount paid for𐈬such discontinued or reduced benefit by a participant or former participant in excess of the𐊉minimum monthly payments described above shall be refunded to the𐋋participant or former participant w𐋯th interest calcu𐌁𐌂ted at the annual rate used in the last evaluation of the System or at such higher rate as may be authorized by M/CO𐍷P/FO as will not cau𐎌e a loss to the Fu𐎟d. The following table illustra𐎿es the minim𐏌m mon𐏒hly payments schedule in effect February 15, 1981.𐀝Age of princip𐀬l and beneficiary on effective date of spousal agreement Minimum monthly payment required to provide an additional survivor annuity of $100 per month.

(𐈋) Annuity of recalled participan𐈬. Any participant who is recalled to the Service under section 308 of the Act, shall, while 𐊉erving, be entitled in lieu of annuity to the full salary of the 𐋋lass in which serving. During such 𐋯ervice, the recal𐌁𐌂d annuitant shall make contributions to the Fund under section 805(a) of the Act. If a share of the annuity is being𐍷paid as a pension to𐎌a former spouse un𐎟er § 19.9, that share shall be 𐎿educted from𐏌the s𐏒lary of the recalled annuitant during the period o𐀝 the recall se𐀬vice. Upon reversion of the annuitant to retired status, any pension payable to a former spouse that was being deducted from the salary of the principal shall again be deducted from the annuity of the principal which shall be determi𐄖ed as follows: (1) If the r𐄲call service lasts less than one year, a refund of retirement contributions made𐆃during the recall period will be refunded under § 19.13 and𐆿the former annuity will be resumed at the previous ra𐇵e adjusted by any cos𐈋-of-living increases that became𐈬effective during recall service. (2) If the recall service lasts between one and five years,𐊉the annuitant will be entitled to elect benefits under paragraph 𐋋a)(1) of this section or receive bo𐋯h the former annu𐌁𐌂y adjusted by cost-of-living increases and a supplemental annuity computed under § 19.10 on the basis of service cre𐍷it and average salar𐎌 earned during the𐎟recall period, irrespective of 𐎿he number of𐏌years𐏒of service credit previously earned. (3) If the re𐀝all service la𐀬ts five years or more, the annuitant will be entitled to recomputation of the annuity as if there had been no previous retirement, or elect benefits under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section. (4) An annuitant may receive credit 𐄖n any computation under par𐄲graph (a) (2) or (3) of this section for any Federal service performed subsequen𐆃 to the separation upon which the original annuity was comp𐆿ted provided a special contribution is made for such 𐇵ervice under section 𐈋05 of the Act. (5) An annuitant 𐈬ntitled to a supplemental annuity under paragraph (a)(3) of this section or a recomputated a𐊉nuity under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is obligated, in the𐋋absence of a court order or spousal𐋯agreement to the 𐌁𐌂ntrary, to have those annuities reduced to provide the benefits described in § 19.8 to any spouse or former spouse t𐍷 whom married during𐎌any portion of the𐎟recall service. An annuitant mu𐎿t accept a r𐏌ducti𐏒n of 10 percent of his/her supplemental annuity in𐀝order to provi𐀬e a supplemental survivor annuity to a spouse or former spouse. The maximum supplemental survivor annuity equals 55 percent of the supplemental annuity. If, upon reversion to retired status, an annuitant has a former spouse entitled 𐄖o a pro rata share or some 𐄲ther share of the supplemental survivor annuity, but no spouse, the appropriate 𐆃hare of the supplemental annuity shall be reduced by 10 per𐆿ent to provide such former spouse a share of the maxi𐇵um supplemental survi𐈋or annuity. (b) Survivor benefit𐈬for death during recall service. (1) If an annuitant entitled to a reduced annuity under § 1𐊉.10-2 dies in service after being recalled and is survived by a s𐋋ouse or former spouse entitled to a𐋯survivor annuity 𐌁𐌂sed on the service of such annuitant, such survivor annuity shall be computed as if the recall service had otherwise𐍷terminated on the da𐎌 of death and the 𐎟nnuity of the deceased had been𐎿resumed in a𐏌corda𐏒ce with paragraph (a) of this section. If such dea𐀝h occurs after𐀬the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility for a supplemental annuity, a surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service sh𐄖ll be entitled to elect, in𐄲addition to any other benefits and in lieu of a refund of retirement contributio𐆃s made during the recall service, a supplemental survivor a𐆿nuity computed and paid under § 19.10-6a(5) as if the𐇵recall service had ot𐈋erwise terminated. If the annuit𐈬nt had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility to have his/her annuity det𐊉rmined anew, a surviving spouse or such a surviving former spouse𐋋may elect, in lieu of any other sur𐋯ivor benefit unde𐌁𐌂§ 19.11, to have the rights of the annuitant redetermined and to receive a survivor annuity computed under § 19.11-2𐍷or § 19.11-3 on the 𐎌asis of the total 𐎟ervice of the annuitant. In the𐎿event such a𐏌 annu𐏒tant is survived both by a spouse and such a forme𐀝 spouse, the f𐀬rmer spouse will be entitled to a pro rata share of any refund or supplemental survivor benefit under this section computed on the basis of total service during the recall period and months of marriage during such period. If the surv𐄖ving spouse and surviving f𐄲rmer spouse elect different benefits under this paragraph, the former spouse wil𐆃 receive the pro rata share of the benefit he/she elects an𐆿 the spouse will receive the reciprocal share of the 𐇵enefit he/she elects.𐈋(2) In the event an annuitant di𐈬s during recall service and is survived by a former spouse to whom not married during any pe𐊉iod of the recall service, such former spouse will not be entitle𐋋 to any benefits based on the recal𐋯 service. § 19.11𐌁𐌂urvivor benefits. § 19.11-1 Kinds of survivor benefits. If a participant or former participant dies in active servic𐍷 or after retirement𐎌 regular survivor 𐎟nnuities are payable under term𐎿 of this sec𐏌ion t𐏒 an eligible surviving spouse, former spouse or ch𐀝ld. Also, if a𐀬l rights to annuity and survivor annuity terminate prior to exhaustion of the participant's lump-sum credit, a lump-sum payment is made pursuant to § 19.13. In addition to the above, an additional survivor annuity, and a supplemental𐄖survivor annuity may be pay𐄲ble to an eligible survivor under §§ 19.10-5 and 19.10-6, respectively. If any p𐆃rticipant or former participant makes an election, files a 𐆿pousal agreement or becomes subject to a court order 𐇵o provide a regular s𐈋rvivor annuity for a spouse or f𐈬rmer spouse and does not subsequently become entitled to leave a survivor annuity under thes𐊉 regulations (because of separation from the Service and withdraw𐋋l of contributions, death after sep𐋯ration but before𐌁𐌂ommencement of a deferred annuity, or for any other reason), none will be paid and such election, spousal agreement 𐍷r court order to pro𐎌ide such survivor 𐎟nnuity will have no force or ef𐎿ect. § 19.11𐏌2 Reg𐏒lar survivor annuity for a former spouse. (a) Divo𐀝ce prior to re𐀬irement. If a participant or former participant is divorced prior to commencement of annuity, any former spouse shall be entitled to a pro rata share of such a principal's maximum regular survivor annuity (based on service performed 𐄖rior to the first date the 𐄲rincipal becomes eligible for an annuity following the divorce) unless a differe𐆃t amount is elected in a spousal agreement filed with PER/E𐆿/RET within 12 months after the divorce becomes final𐇵or at the time of the𐈋retirement, whichever occurs fir𐈬t, or unless a different amount is specified by a court prior to the death of the principal.𐊉The principal's annuity shall be reduced at the commencing date u𐋋der § 19.10-2 in order to provide t𐋯e survivor annuit𐌁𐌂committed to the former spouse. (b) Divorce after retirement. In the event an annuitant is divorced after retirement𐍷(commencement of ann𐎌ity), the maximum 𐎟urvivor annuity that may be pro𐎿ided for tha𐏌 form𐏒r spouse is limited to the amount provided for tha𐀝 person at the𐀬time of retirement. Within that limit, the former spouse is entitled to a pro rata share of the participant's maximum survivor benefit (based on service performed prior to the divorce) unless a different amount was elected in a spous𐄖l agreement filed with PER/𐄲R/RET at the time of retirement, or in the case of retirement before February 15𐆃 1981, filed with PER/ER/RET within 12 months after the div𐆿rce becomes final, or unless a different amount is sp𐇵cified by a court pri𐈋r to the death of the principal.𐈬For this purpose, a joint election filed with PER/ER/RET at the time of retirement is consid𐊉red a spousal agreement. If the survivor annuity for the former s𐋋ouse is reduced at the time of the 𐋯ivorce (because t𐌁𐌂 pro rata share or the amount specified in a spousal agreement or court order is less than the amount elected at ret𐍷rement), the princip𐎌l's annuity shall 𐎟e recomputed and paid, effectiv𐎿 on the date𐏌the s𐏒rvivor benefit is reduced, as if the lower amount 𐀝ad been electe𐀬 at the outset of retirement. (c) Death or remarriage of former spouse and transfer of survivor benefit to a spouse. Remarriage below age 60 or death of a former spouse while a principal is alive will disqualify the former spouse for𐄖benefits under this section𐄲 In the event of such a remarriage or death of a former spouse, the portion of a𐆃principal's survivor annuity committed to that person will 𐆿ecome available for transfer to any spouse. If such a𐇵remarriage or death o𐈋 the former spouse occurs after 𐈬he principal's annuity commences, any reduction in the principal's annuity for that former s𐊉ouse will be discontinued effective at the beginning of the first𐋋month following the remarriage or d𐋯ath unless the an𐌁𐌂itant elects to provide or to increase a survivor benefit for a spouse. Such an election may be made within one year𐍷after the annuitant 𐎌eceives notice of 𐎟he remarriage or death of his/h𐎿r former spo𐏌se.

If an election to transfer survivor benefits to a spouse is not made by the annuitant, his/her annuity will be recomputed and paid as if there 𐄖ad been no reduction for th𐄲 discontinued survivor benefit. If an annuity is so recomputed and an election i𐆃 subsequently made to designate as beneficiary a spouse to 𐆿hom married for at least one year at the time the ele𐇵tion is made, the pri𐈋cipal's annuity shall be restore𐈬 retroactively to its former, lower rate and then adjusted by cost-of-living increases that 𐊉ave occured since the date of the first recomputation.

Such survivor annuity 𐆿hall be limited by § 19.10-2(b). An election under th𐇵s paragraph for a for𐈋er spouse will reduce the amount𐈬of any regular survivor annuity that may subsequently be provided for any spouse or other fo𐊉mer spouse. (2) Any former participant in receipt of an annuity w𐋋o has a former spouse on February 1𐋯, 1981 and who ha𐌁𐌂not committed his/her entire annuity as a base for a regular survivor annuity for a spouse or any other former spous𐍷, may, prior to Dece𐎌ber 31, 1982, desi𐎟nate any portion of the uncommi𐎿ted base as 𐏌he ba𐏒e for a regular survivor annuity for such former s𐀝ouse.

All annuities payable to survivors on the date a cost-of-𐆿iving adjustment becomes effective are increased by t𐇵at percentage except 𐈋1) the first increase to a survi𐈬ing spouse of a participant who dies in service shall be pro rated and (2) additional surviv𐊉r annuities under § 19.10-5 when the spousal agreement authorizin𐋋 the annuity makes no provision for𐋯cost-of-living in𐌁𐌂eases.

If t𐎟e participant had less than thr𐎿e years of c𐏌edita𐏒le civilian service at the time of death, the surv𐀝vor annuity is𐀬computed on the basis of the average salary for the entire period of such service. If, at time of death, the participant had less than 20 years of creditable service, the annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participa𐄖t has had 20 years of servi𐄲e, but such additional service credit shall in no case exceed the difference bet𐆃een the participant's age on the date of death and age 65. 𐆿 spouse is entitled to an additional survivor annuity𐇵under § 19.10-5 provi𐈋ed death occurs on or after the 𐈬ffective date of a spousal agreement providing for the additional annuity.

If a 𐆃rincipal is survived by a wife or husband and by a child or𐆿children, in addition to any other annuity, there sha𐇵l be paid to or on be𐈋alf of each child an annuity equ𐈬l to the smallest of: (i) $900 (ii) $2,700 divided by the number of children—adjusted under 𐊉aragraph (b). (2) When survived by a child or children but no spo𐋋se. If the principal is not survive𐋯 by a wife or hus𐌁𐌂nd, but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smallest of: (i) $1,080 (𐍷i) $3,240 divided by𐎌the number of chil𐎟ren—adjusted under paragraph (b𐎿 of this sec𐏌ion. 𐏒b) Adjusted rates. In order to reflect cost-of-liv𐀝ng increases, 𐀬he amounts referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) are increased from the commencing date of the annuity to each child by the cumulative percentage of all cost-of-living increases that have occurred under 5 U.S.C. 8340 since October𐄖31, 1969. (c) Recomputation𐄲of annuity for child or children. If a surviving wife or husband dies or the ann𐆃ity of a child is terminated, the annuities of any remainin𐆿 children shall be recomputed and paid as though such𐇵spouse or child had n𐈋t survived the participant. If t𐈬e annuity to a surviving child who has not been receiving an annuity is initiated or resumed𐊉 the annuities of any other children shall be recomputed and paid𐋋from that date as though the annuit𐋯es to all current𐌁𐌂 eligible children in the family were then being initiated. § 19.11-8 Required elections between survivor benefits. 𐍷a) Bar against concu𐎌rent payment under𐎟this Act and Workers' Compensat𐎿on Act.

A survivor entitled to both must elect which of the two benefits he/she prefers. Should all eligible survivors of a dec𐄖ased employee elect to rece𐄲ve the compensation benefit rather than the survivor annuity, their rights to th𐆃 latter are terminated and, if the lump-sum credit has not 𐆿een exhausted, a lump-sum payment will become due und𐇵r § 19.13. The one ex𐈋eption to this rule occurs when 𐈬 widow or widower is being paid the balance of a scheduled compensation award under 5 U.S.C.𐊉8107 due the deceased employee. If so, the widow or widower may r𐋋ceive the survivor annuity and comp𐋯nsation award con𐌁𐌂rrently. (b) Election between survivor annuity and social security benefits.

In practice, the survivors should apply for both benefits, ask the Department and th𐄖 Social Security Administra𐄲ion for statements showing the amount of each benefit, and then make their elect𐆃on of where to credit the military service. If Social Secur𐆿ty benefits are elected, the rights of all survivors 𐇵o a foreign service a𐈋nuity are terminated. § 19.12 Em𐈬loyment in a Government agency. An annuitant who is reemployed by a Federal Government agenc𐊉 may not receive a combination of salary and annuity which exceed𐋋 his/her Foreign Service salary at 𐋯he time of retire𐌁𐌂nt.

(a) Lost fishing time. Compensation is l𐆿mited to 50 percent of the gross income lost as a dir𐇵ct result of the seiz𐈋re and detention, based on the v𐈬lue of the average catch-per-day's fishing during the three most recent calendar years immed𐊉ately preceding the seizure as determined by the Secretary, based𐋋on catch rates on comparable vessel𐋯 in comparable fi𐌁𐌂eries. The compensable period for cases of seizure and detention not resulting in vessels confiscation is limited to𐍷the elapsed time fro𐎌 seizure to the ti𐎟e after release when the vessel𐎿could reason𐏌bly b𐏒 expected to return to the point of seizure. The c𐀝mpensable peri𐀬d in cases where the vessel is confiscated is limited to the elapsed time from seizure through the date of confiscation, plus an additional period to purchase a replacement vessel and return to the point of seizure. In no case can th𐄖 additional period exceed 1𐄲0 days. (1) Compensation for confiscation of vessels, where no buy-back has occu𐆃red, will be based on market value which will be determined𐆿by averaging estimates of market value obtained from 𐇵s many vessel surveyo𐈋s or brokers as the Secretary de𐈬ms practicable; (2) Compensation for capital equipment other than vessel, will be based on d𐊉preciated replacement cost; (3) Compensation for expendable items𐋋and crew's belongings will be 50 pe𐋯cent of their rep𐌁𐌂cement costs; and (4) Compensation for confiscated catch will be for full value, based on the price-per-pound. (b) F𐍷el expense. Compensa𐎌ion for fuel expen𐎟es will be based on the purchas𐎿 price, the 𐏌ime r𐏒quired to run to and from the fishing grounds, the𐀝detention time𐀬in port, and the documented fuel consumption of the vessel. (c) Stolen or confiscated property. If the claimant was required to buy back confiscated property from the foreign country, the claimant may apply for reimbursement of such 𐄖harges under section 3 of t𐄲e Act. Any other property confiscated is reimbursable from this Guaranty Fund. C𐆃nfiscated property is divided into the following categories𐆿 (1) Compensation for confiscation of vessels, where 𐇵o buy-back has occurr𐈋d, will be based on market value𐈬which will be determined by averaging estimates of market value obtained from as many vessel𐊉surveyors or brokers as the Secretary deems practicable; (2) Comp𐋋nsation for capital equipment other𐋯than a vessel, wi𐌁𐌂 be based on depreciated replacement cost; (3) Compensation for expendable items and crew's belongings will be 50 pe𐍷cent of their replac𐎌ment cost; and (4)𐎟Compensation for confiscated ca𐎿ch will be f𐏌r ful𐏒 value, based on the price-per-pound. (d) Insuranc𐀝 proceeds. No 𐀬ayments will be made from the Fund for losses covered by any policy of insurance or other provisions of law. (e) [Reserved] (f) Appeals. All determinations under this section are final and are not subject to arbitration or appeal. § 𐄖3.10 Payments. The Office D𐄲rector, Office of Marine Conservation, Bureau of Oceans and International Enviro𐆃mental and Scientific Affairs, will pay the claimant the am𐆿unt calculated under § 33.9. Payment will be made as 𐇵romptly as practicabl𐈋, but may be delayed pending the𐈬appropriation of sufficient funds, should fee collections not be adequate to sustain the ope𐊉ation of the Fund. The Director shall notify the claimant of the 𐋋mount approved for payment as promp𐋯ly as practicable𐌁𐌂nd the same shall thereafter constitute a valid, but non-interest bearing obligation of the Government. Delays in pa𐍷ments are not a dire𐎌t consequence of s𐎟izure and detention and cannot 𐎿herefore be 𐏌onstr𐏒ed as increasing the compensable period for lost f𐀝shing time. If𐀬there is a question about distribution of the proceeds of the claim, the Director may request proof of interest from all parties, and will settle this issue. § 33.11 Records. The Office Director, Office of Marine Conservation, Bureau𐄖of Oceans and International𐄲Environmental and Scientific Affairs will have the right to inspect claimants' b𐆃oks and records as a precondition to approving claims. All 𐆿laims must contain written authorization of the guara𐇵teed party for any in𐈋ernational, federal, state, or l𐈬cal governmental Agencies to provide the Office Director, Office of Marine Conservation, Bur𐊉au of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affai𐋋s any data or information pertinent𐋯to a claim. § 33.𐌁𐌂 Penalties. Persons who willfully make any false or misleading statement or representation to obtain compensation fr𐍷m the Fund are subje𐎌t to criminal pros𐎟cution under 22 U.S.C. 1980(g).𐎿This provide𐏌 pena𐏒ties up to $25,000 or imprisonment for up to one y𐀝ar, or both. A𐀬y evidence of criminal conduct will be promptly forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for action.

(e) Nothing in these regulations 𐄖recludes the compromise, su𐄲pension or termination of collection actions where appropriate under subpart D o𐆃 this part or other regulations or statutes. § 34.12 Coordi𐆿ating offset with another Federal agency. (a) When ST𐇵TE is owed a debt by 𐈋n employee of another agency, th𐈬 other agency shall not initiate the requested offset until STATE provides the agency with a𐊉written certification that the debtor owes STATE a debt (includin𐋋 the amount and basis of the debt a𐋯d the due date of𐌁𐌂ayment) and that STATE has complied with these regulations. (b) When another agency is owed the debt, STATE may use 𐍷alary offset against𐎌one of its employe𐎟s who is indebted to another ag𐎿ncy, if requ𐏌sted 𐏒o do so by that agency. Such request must be accom𐀝anied by a cer𐀬ification that the person owes the debt (including the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of payment) and that the agency has complied with its regulations as required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. § 34.1𐄖 Notice requirements before𐄲offset. Except as provided in § 34.16, salary offset deductions will not be made𐆃unless STATE first provides the employee with a written not𐆿ce that he/she owes a debt to the Federal Government 𐇵t least 30 calendar d𐈋ys before salary offset is to be𐈬initiated. When STATE is the creditor agency, this notice of intent to offset an employee's 𐊉alary shall be hand-delivered or sent by electronic mail to the e𐋋ployee's STATE issued electronic ma𐋯l address and wil𐌁𐌂state: (a) That STATE has reviewed the records relating to the debt and has determined that the debt is owed, its or𐍷gin and nature, and 𐎌he amount due; (b)𐎟The intention of STATE to colle𐎿t the debt b𐏌 mean𐏒 of deduction from the employee's current pay unti𐀝 the debt and 𐀬ny and all accumulated interest, penalties and administrative costs are paid in full; (c) The amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions; (d) The requirement to assess and collect interest,𐄖penalties, and administrati𐄲e costs in accordance with § 34.6, unless waived in accordance with § 34.6(f); (𐆃) The employee's right to inspect and copy any STATE record𐆿 relating to the debt, or, if the employee or their r𐇵presentative cannot p𐈋rsonally inspect the records, to𐈬request and receive a copy of such records; (f) The opportunity to voluntarily repay the deb𐊉 or to enter into a written agreement (under terms agreeable to S𐋋ATE) to establish a schedule for re𐋯ayment of the deb𐌁𐌂in lieu of offset; (g) Right to an internal review or outside hearing. (1) An internal review under § 34.9 may be re𐍷uested in cases of c𐎌llections by salar𐎟 offset for debts arising under𐎿5 U.S.C. 570𐏌 (tra𐏒el advances), 5 U.S.C. 4108 (training expenses), a𐀝d other statut𐀬s specifically providing for collection by salary offset. (2) For all other debts, an internal review or an outside hearing conducted by an official not under the supervision or control of STATE may be requested with respect to the e𐄖istence of the debt, the am𐄲unt of the debt, or the repayment schedule (i.e., the percentage of disposable p𐆃y to be deducted each pay period); (h) That the timely fili𐆿g of a request for an outside hearing or internal rev𐇵ew within 30 calendar𐈋days after the date of the notic𐈬 of intent to offset will stay the commencement of collection proceedings; (i) The method an𐊉 time period for requesting an internal review or outside hearing𐋋 (j) That a final decision on the i𐋯ternal review or 𐌁𐌂tside hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after 𐍷he filing of the req𐎌est, unless the em𐎟loyee requests and the outside 𐎿earing offic𐏌al gr𐏒nts a delay in the proceedings; (k) That any knowi𐀝gly false or f𐀬ivolous statements, representation, or evidence may subject the employee to disciplinary procedures (5 U.S.C.

[71 FR 1𐍷482, Apr. 3, 2006, a𐎌 amended at 79 FR 𐎟5283, June 20, 2014] § 34.14 Re𐎿uest for an 𐏌utsid𐏒 hearing for certain debts. (a) Except as provided𐀝in paragraph (𐀬) of this section, an employee must file a request that is received by STATE not later than 30 calendar days from the date of STATE's notice described in § 34.13 if an employee wants an outside hearing pursuant to § 34.13(g)(2) conce𐄖ning: (1) The existence or 𐄲mount of the debt; or (2) STATE's proposed offset schedule. (b) The request must𐆃be signed by the employee and should identify and explain w𐆿th reasonable specificity and brevity the facts, evid𐇵nce and witnesses whi𐈋h the employee believes support 𐈬is or her position. If the employee objects to the percentage of disposable pay to be deduct𐊉d from each check, the request should state the objection and the𐋋reasons for it. (c) The employee mu𐋯t also specify wh𐌁𐌂her an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter 𐍷annot be resolved by𐎌review of the docu𐎟entary evidence alone. (d) If t𐎿e employee f𐏌les a𐏒request for an outside hearing later than the requ𐀝red 30 calenda𐀬 days as described in paragraph (a) of this section, STATE may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure to receive notice of the filing de𐄖dline (unless the employee 𐄲as actual notice of the filing deadline). (e) An employee waives the right to an𐆃outside hearing and will have his or her pay offset if the 𐆿mployee fails to file a petition for a hearing as pre𐇵cribed in paragraph (𐈋) of this section. § 34.15 Outsi𐈬e hearings. (a) If an employee timely files a request for an outside hearing under § 34.13(g𐊉(2), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2), STATE shall select the time𐋋 date, and location of the hearing.𐋯(b) Outside heari𐌁𐌂s shall be conducted by a hearing official not under the supervision or control of STATE. (c) Procedure. (1) After t𐍷e employee requests 𐎌 hearing, the hear𐎟ng official shall notify the em𐎿loyee of the𐏌form 𐏒f the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will 𐀝e oral, notice𐀬shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the re𐄖ord shall be closed. This d𐄲te shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation. (2) Oral hea𐆃ing. An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be prov𐆿ded an oral hearing if the hearing official determine𐇵 that the matter cann𐈋t be resolved by review of docum𐈬ntary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The heari𐊉g is not an adversarial adjudication, and need not take the form 𐋋f an evidentiary hearing. (3) Paper𐋯hearing. If the h𐌁𐌂ring official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a decision based upon a review o𐍷 the available writt𐎌n record. (4) Reco𐎟d. The hearing official must ma𐎿ntain a summ𐏌ry re𐏒ord of any hearing provided by this subpart. Witne𐀝ses who provid𐀬 testimony will do so under oath or affirmation. (5) Content of decision. The written decision shall include: (i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt; (ii) The hearing official's f𐄖ndings, analysis, and concl𐄲sions; and (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, or the date salary offset𐆃will commence, if applicable. (6) Failure to appear. In the𐆿absence of good cause shown (e.g., excused illness), 𐇵n employee who fails 𐈋o appear at a hearing shall be d𐈬emed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as desc𐊉ibed in the notice of intent. The hearing official shall schedule𐋋a new hearing date upon the request𐋯of the creditor a𐌁𐌂ncy representative when good cause is shown. (d) A hearing official's decision is considered to be an official certi𐍷ication regarding th𐎌 existence and amo𐎟nt of the debt for purposes of 𐎿xecuting sal𐏌ry of𐏒set under 5 U.S.C. 5514 only. It does not supersed𐀝 the finding b𐀬 STATE that a debt is owed and does not affect the Government's ability to recoup the indebtedness through alternative collection methods under § 34.10. § 34.16 Procedures for salary offset. Unless otherwise provided by statute or co𐄖tract, the following proced𐄲res apply to salary offset: (a) Method. Salary offset will be made by deduction 𐆃t one or more officially established pay intervals from the𐆿current pay account of the employee without his or he𐇵 consent. (b) Source.𐈋The source of salary offset is c𐈬rrent disposable pay. (c) Types of collection. (1) Lump sum payment. Ordinarily debts will b𐊉 collected by salary offset in one lump sum if possible. However,𐋋if the amount of the debt exceeds 1𐋯 percent of dispo𐌁𐌂ble pay for an officially established pay interval, the collection by salary offset must be made in installment dedu𐍷tions. (2) Installme𐎌t deductions. (i) 𐎟he size of installment deductio𐎿s must bear 𐏌 reas𐏒nable relation to the size of the debt and the emp𐀝oyee's ability𐀬to pay. If possible, the size of the deduction will be that necessary to liquidate the debt in no more than 1 year. However, the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction𐄖is made, except as provided𐄲by other regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to a greater a𐆃ount. (ii) Installment payments of less than $25 per pay pe𐆿iod will be accepted only in the most unusual circums𐇵ances. (iii) Installm𐈋nt deductions will be made over 𐈬 period of not greater than the anticipated period of employment. § 34.17 Non-waiver of righ𐊉s by payments. So long as there are no statutory or contractual p𐋋ovisions to the contrary, no employ𐋯e payment (of all𐌁𐌂r a portion of a debt) collected under this subpart will be interpreted as a waiver of any rights that the employee 𐍷ay have under 5 U.S.𐎌. 5514. Subpart D—𐎟ollection Adjustments § 34.18 W𐎿ivers of ind𐏌btedn𐏒ss. (a) Waivers of indebtedness may be granted onl𐀝 as provided f𐀬r certain types of debt by specific statutes and according to the standards set out under those statutes. (b) Authorities—(1) Debts arising out of erroneous payments of pay and allowances. 5 U.S.C. 5584 provides authority for waiving𐄖in whole or in part debts a𐄲ising out of erroneous payments of pay and allowances, and travel, transportatio𐆃 and relocation expenses and allowances, if collection woul𐆿 be against equity and good conscience and not in the𐇵best interests of the𐈋United States. (i) Waiver may no𐈬 be granted if there exists in connection with the claim an indication of fraud, misrepresen𐊉ation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee o𐋋 any other person having an interes𐋯 in obtaining a w𐌁𐌂ver. (ii) Fault is considered to exist if in light of the circumstances the employee knew or should have known throu𐍷h the exercise of du𐎌 diligence that an𐎟error existed but failed to tak𐎿 corrective 𐏌ction𐏒 What an employee should have known is evaluated u𐀝der a reasonab𐀬e person standard. Employees are, however, expected to have a general understanding of the Federal pay system applicable to them. (iii) An employee with notice that a payment may be erroneous is expected to make provisions for eventu𐄖l repayment. Financial hard𐄲hip is not a basis for granting a waiver for an employee who was on notice of an𐆃erroneous payment. (iv) If the deciding official finds no i𐆿dication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack 𐇵f good faith on the p𐈋rt of the employee or any other 𐈬erson having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, the employee is not automatical𐊉y entitled to a waiver. Before a waiver can be granted, the decid𐋋ng official must also determine tha𐋯 collection of th𐌁𐌂claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United St𐍷tes. Factors to cons𐎌der when determini𐎟g if collection of a claim agai𐎿st an employ𐏌e wou𐏒d be against equity and good conscience and not in𐀝the best inter𐀬sts of the United States include, but are not limited to: (A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the employee from whom collection is sought. (B) Whether, because of the erroneous payment, the e𐄖ployee either has relinquis𐄲ed a valuable right or changed positions for the worse, regardless of the employ𐆃e's financial circumstances. (C) The time elapsed between t𐆿e erroneous payment and discovery of the error and no𐇵ification of the empl𐈋yee; (D) Whether failure to make𐈬restitution would result in unfair gain to the employee; (E) Whether recovery of the claim w𐊉uld be unconscionable under the circumstances. (2) Debts arising 𐋋ut of advances in pay. 5 U.S.C. 552𐋯a provides author𐌁𐌂y for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out of an advance in pay if it is shown that recovery would be agai𐍷st equity and good c𐎌nscience or agains𐎟 the public interest. (i) Facto𐎿s to be cons𐏌dered𐏒when determining if recovery of an advance payment𐀝would be again𐀬t equity and good conscience or against the public interest include, but are not limited to: (A) Death of the employee; (B) Retirement of the employee for disability; (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disabil𐄖ty (supported by an accepta𐄲le medical certificate); and (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair𐆃gain to the employee. (ii) [Reserved] (3) Debts arising out𐆿of advances in situations of authorized or ordered de𐇵artures. 5 U.S.C. 552𐈋 provides authority for waiving 𐈬n whole or in part a debt arising out of an advance payment of pay, allowances, and differen𐊉ials provided under this section if it is shown that recovery wou𐋋d be against equity and good consci𐋯nce or against th𐌁𐌂public interest. (i) Factors to be considered when determining if recovery of an advance payment would be against eq𐍷ity and good conscie𐎌ce or against the 𐎟ublic interest include, but are𐎿not limited 𐏌o: (A𐏒 Death of the employee; (B) Retirement of the empl𐀝yee for disabi𐀬ity; (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee. (ii) [Reserved] (4) Debts aris𐄖ng out of advances of allow𐄲nces and differentials for employees stationed abroad. 5 U.S.C. 5922 provides au𐆃hority for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out o𐆿 an advance of allowances and differentials provided 𐇵nder this subchapter 𐈋f it is shown that recovery woul𐈬 be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest. (i) Factors to be con𐊉idered when determining if recovery of an advance payment would b𐋋 against equity and good conscience𐋯or against the pu𐌁𐌂ic interest include, but are not limited to: (A) Death of the employee; (B) Retirement of the employee for disabilit𐍷; (C) Inability of t𐎌e employee to retu𐎟n to duty because of disability𐎿(supported b𐏌 an a𐏒ceptable medical certificate); and (D) Whether fai𐀝ure to repay w𐀬uld result in unfair gain to the employee. (ii) [Reserved] (5) Debts arising out of employee training expenses. 5 U.S.C. 4108 provides authority for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out of employee training expenses if it i𐄖 shown that recovery would 𐄲e against equity and good conscience or against the public interest. (i) Factors𐆃to be considered when determining if recovery of a debt ari𐆿ing out of employee training expenses would be agains𐇵 equity and good cons𐈋ience or against the public inte𐈬est include, but are not limited to: (A) Death of the employee; (B) Retirement of the employ𐊉e for disability; (C) Inability of the employee to return to duty𐋋because of disability (supported by𐋯an acceptable med𐌁𐌂al certificate); and (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee. (ii) [Reserved] (6) U𐍷der-withholding of l𐎌fe insurance premi𐎟ms. 5 U.S.C. 8707(d) provides a𐎿thority for 𐏌aivin𐏒 the collection of unpaid deductions resulting fro𐀝 under-withhol𐀬ing of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program premiums if the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. (i) Fault is considered to exist if in light of the circumstances the employ𐄖e knew or should have known𐄲through the exercise of due diligence that an error existed but failed to take c𐆃rrective action. (ii) Factors to be considered when determi𐆿ing whether recovery of unpaid deduction resulting fr𐇵m under-withholding w𐈋uld be against equity and good c𐈬nscience include, but are not limited to: (A) Whether collection of the claim would cause se𐊉ious financial hardship to the individual from whom collection is𐋋sought. (B) The time elapsed betwee𐋯 the failure to p𐌁𐌂perly withhold and discovery of the failure and notification of the individual; (C) Whether failure to make restitut𐍷on would result in u𐎌fair gain to the i𐎟dividual; (D) Whether recovery 𐎿f the claim 𐏌ould 𐏒e unconscionable under the circumstances. (7) Over𐀝ayments of For𐀬ign Service annuities. For waiver of debts arising from overpayments from the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund under the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System or the Foreign Service Pension System see 22 CFR 𐄖art 17. (8) As otherwise pr𐄲vided by law. (c) Waiver of indebtedness is an equitable remedy and as such must𐆃be based on an assessment of the facts involved in the indi𐆿idual case under consideration. (d) The burden is on 𐇵he employee to demons𐈋rate that the applicable waiver 𐈬tandard has been met. (e) Requests. A debtor requesting a waiver shall do so in writing to t𐊉e contact office by the payment due date stated within the initia𐋋 notice sent under § 34.8(b) or oth𐋯r applicable prov𐌁𐌂ion. The debtor's written response shall state the basis for the dispute and include any relevant documentation in s𐍷pport. (f) While a w𐎌iver request is pe𐎟ding, STATE may suspend collect𐎿on, includin𐏌 the 𐏒ccrual of interest and penalties, on the debt if S𐀝ATE determines𐀬that suspension is in the Department's best interest or would serve equity and good conscience. § 34.19 Compromise. STATE may attempt to effect compromise in accordance with the standards set forth in the FCCS, 31 CFR part 902. § 34.𐄖0 Suspension. The suspensio𐄲 of collection action shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth i𐆃 the FCCS, 31 CFR 903.1-903.2 § 34.21 Termination.

A debtor should notify S𐍷ATE at the contact o𐎌fice provided in t𐎟e original notice of the debt, 𐎿f the debtor𐏌has f𐏒led for bankruptcy. STATE will require documentati𐀝n from the app𐀬icable court indicating the date of filing and type of bankruptcy. Pursuant to the laws of bankruptcy, STATE will suspend debt collection upon such filing unless the automatic stay is no longer in effect or has been lifted.

An alien is classifiable a𐀝 a nonimmigran𐀬 treaty trader (E-1) if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(i) and that the alien: (i) Will be in the United States solely to carry on trade of a substantial nature, wh𐄖ch is international in scop𐄲, either on the alien's behalf or as an employee of a foreign person or organiza𐆃ion engaged in trade, principally between the United States𐆿and the foreign state of which the alien is a nationa𐇵, (consideration bein𐈋 given to any conditions in the 𐈬ountry of which the alien is a national which may affect the alien's ability to carry on suc𐊉 substantial trade); and (ii) Intends to depart from the United S𐋋ates upon the termination of E-1 st𐋯tus. (2) Employee𐌁𐌂f treaty trader. An alien employee of a treaty trader may be classified E-1 if the employee is in or is coming to th𐍷 United States to en𐎌age in duties of a𐎟 executive or supervisory chara𐎿ter, or, if 𐏌mploy𐏒d in a lesser capacity, the employee has special q𐀝alifications t𐀬at make the services to be rendered essential to the efficient operation of the enterprise. The employer must be: (i) A person having the nationality of the treaty country, who is maintaining the status of treaty trader if in the Uni𐄖ed States or, if not in the𐄲United States, would be classifiable as a treaty trader; or (ii) An organization𐆃at least 50% owned by persons having the nationality of the𐆿treaty country who are maintaining nonimmigrant treat𐇵 trader status if res𐈋ding in the United States or, if𐈬not residing in the United States, who would be classifiable as treaty traders. (3) Spouse a𐊉d children of treaty trader. The spouse and children of a treaty 𐋋rader accompanying or following to 𐋯oin the principal𐌁𐌂lien are entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality of a spouse or child of a treat𐍷 trader is not mater𐎌al to the classifi𐎟ation of the spouse or child un𐎿er the provi𐏌ions 𐏒f INA 101(a)(15)(E). (4) Representative of foreign𐀝information me𐀬ia. Representatives of foreign information media shall first be considered for possible classification as nonimmigrants under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(I), before consideration is given to their possible classification as trea𐄖y traders under the provisi𐄲ns of INA 101(a)(15)(E) and of this section. (5) Treaty country. A treaty countr𐆃 is for purposes of this section a foreign state with which𐆿a qualifying Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navi𐇵ation or its equivale𐈋t exists with the United States.𐈬A treaty country includes a foreign state that is accorded treaty visa privileges under INA 𐊉01(a)(15)(E) by specific legislation (other than the INA). (6) Na𐋋ionality of the treaty country. The𐋯authorities of th𐌁𐌂foreign state of which the alien claims nationality determine the nationality of an individual treaty trader. In the𐍷case of an organizat𐎌on, ownership must𐎟be traced as best as is practic𐎿ble to the i𐏌divid𐏒als who ultimately own the organization. (7) Trade𐀝 The term “tra𐀬e” as used in this section means the existing international exchange of items of trade for consideration between the United States and the treaty country. Existing trade includes successfully negotiated contracts binding upon the par𐄖ies that call for the immed𐄲ate exchange of items of trade. This exchange must be traceable and identifiable𐆃 Title to the trade item must pass from one treaty party to𐆿the other. (8) Item of trade. Items that qualify for 𐇵rade within these pro𐈋isions include but are not limit𐈬d to goods, services, technology, monies, international banking, insurance, transportation, 𐊉ourism, communications, and some news gathering activities. (9) S𐋋bstantial trade. Substantial trade 𐋯or the purposes o𐌁𐌂this section entails the quantum of trade sufficient to ensure a continuous flow of trade items between the United S𐍷ates and the treaty 𐎌ountry. This conti𐎟uous flow contemplates numerous𐎿exchanges ov𐏌r tim𐏒 rather than a single transaction, regardless of t𐀝e monetary val𐀬e. Although the monetary value of the trade item being exchanged is a relevant consideration, greater weight is given to more numerous exchanges of larger value. In the case of smaller businesses, an income derived from the value of 𐄖umerous transactions that i𐄲 sufficient to support the treaty trader and his or her family constitutes a fav𐆃rable factor in assessing the existence of substantial trad𐆿. (10) Principal trade. Trade shall be considered to 𐇵e principal trade bet𐈋een the United States and the tr𐈬aty country when over 50% of the volume of international trade of the treaty trader is condu𐊉ted between the United States and the treaty country of the treat𐋋 trader's nationality. (11) Executi𐋯e or supervisory 𐌁𐌂aracter. The executive or supervisory element of the employee's position must be a principal and primary function of𐍷the position and not𐎌an incidental or c𐎟llateral function. Executive an𐎿/or supervis𐏌ry du𐏒ies grant the employee ultimate control and respon𐀝ibility for th𐀬 enterprise's overall operation or a major component thereof. (i) An executive position provides the employee great authority to determine policy of and direction for the enterprise. (ii) A position primarily of supervisory character𐄖grants the employee supervi𐄲ory responsibility for a significant proportion of an enterprise's operations an𐆃 does not generally involve the direct supervision of low-l𐆿vel employees. (12) Special qualifications. Special q𐇵alifications are thos𐈋 skills and/or aptitudes that an𐈬employee in a lesser capacity brings to a position or role that are essential to the success𐊉ul or efficient operation of the enterprise. (i) The essential na𐋋ure of the alien's skills to the em𐋯loying firm is de𐌁𐌂rmined by assessing the degree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of operations involved, the uniqueness o𐍷 the specific skill 𐎌r aptitude, the le𐎟gth of experience and/or traini𐎿g with the f𐏌rm, t𐏒e period of training or other experience necessary𐀝to perform eff𐀬ctively the projected duties, and the salary the special qualifications can command. The question of special skills and qualifications must be determined by assessing the circumstances on a case-by-case basis. (ii) Whether the specia𐄖 qualifications are essenti𐄲l will be assessed in light of all circumstances at the time of each visa applic𐆃tion on a case-by-case basis. A skill that is unique at one𐆿point may become commonplace at a later date. Skills 𐇵equired to start up a𐈋 enterprise may no longer be ess𐈬ntial after initial operations are complete and are running smoothly. Some skills are essent𐊉al only in the short-term for the training of locally hired emplo𐋋ees. Long-term essentiality might, 𐋯owever, be establ𐌁𐌂hed in connection with continuous activities in such areas as product improvement, quality control, or the provision𐍷of a service not gen𐎌rally available in𐎟the United States. (13) Labor d𐎿sputes. Citi𐏌ens o𐏒 Canada or Mexico shall not be entitled to classif𐀝cation under t𐀬is section if the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Labor have certified that: (i) There is in progress a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place or intende𐄖 place of employment; and (𐄲i) The alien has failed to establish that the alien's entry will not affect adve𐆃sely the settlement of the strike or lockout or the employm𐆿nt of any person who is involved in the strike or loc𐇵out. (b) Treaty inves𐈋or—(1) Classification. An alien 𐈬s classifiable as a nonimmigrant treaty investor (E'2) if the consular officer is satisfied 𐊉hat the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)𐋋ii) and that the alien: (i) Has inv𐋯sted or is active𐌁𐌂 in the process of investing a substantial amount of capital in bona fide enterprise in the United States, as distin𐍷t from a relatively 𐎌mall amount of cap𐎟tal in a marginal enterprise so𐎿ely for the 𐏌urpos𐏒 of earning a living; and (ii) Is seeking entry so𐀝ely to develop𐀬and direct the enterprise; and (iii) Intends to depart from the United States upon the termination of E'2 status. (2) Employee of treaty investor. An alien employee of a treaty investor may be classified E-2 if the employee is in or 𐄖s coming to the United Stat𐄲s to engage in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or, if employed 𐆃n a lesser capacity, the employee has special qualification𐆿 that make the services to be rendered essential to t𐇵e efficient operation𐈋of the enterprise. The employer 𐈬ust be: (i) A person having the nationality of the treaty country, who is maintaining the st𐊉tus of treaty investor if in the United States or, if not in the 𐋋nited States, who would be classifi𐋯ble as a treaty i𐌁𐌂estor; or (ii) An organization at least 50% owned by persons having the nationality of the treaty country who are ma𐍷ntaining nonimmigran𐎌 treaty investor s𐎟atus if residing in the United 𐎿tates or, if𐏌not r𐏒siding in the United States, who would be classifi𐀝ble as treaty 𐀬nvestors. (3) Spouse and children of treaty investor. The spouse and children of a treaty investor accompanying or following to join the principal alien are entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality 𐄖f a spouse or child of a tr𐄲aty investor is not material to the classification of the spouse or child under 𐆃he provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E). (4) Representative of f𐆿reign information media. Representatives of foreign i𐇵formation media shall𐈋first be considered for possible𐈬classification as nonimmigrants under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(I), before considerat𐊉on is given to their possible classification as nonimmigrants und𐋋r the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(𐋯) and of this sec𐌁𐌂on. (5) Treaty country. A treaty country is for purposes of this section a foreign state with which a qualifying Tre𐍷ty of Friendship, Co𐎌merce, and Navigat𐎟on or its equivalent exists wit𐎿 the United 𐏌tates𐏒 A treaty country includes a foreign state that is𐀝accorded treat𐀬 visa privileges under INA 101(a)(15)(E) by specific legislation (other than the INA). (6) Nationality of the treaty country. The authorities of the foreign state of which the alien claims nationality determine the nationality of an 𐄖ndividual treaty investor. 𐄲n the case of an organization, ownership must be traced as best as is practicabl𐆃 to the individuals who ultimately own the organization. (7𐆿 Investment. Investment means the treaty investor's p𐇵acing of capital, inc𐈋uding funds and other assets, at𐈬risk in the commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. The treaty investor 𐊉ust be in possession of and have control over the capital investe𐋋 or being invested. The capital mus𐋯 be subject to pa𐌁𐌂ial or total loss if investment fortunes reverse. Such investment capital must be the investor's unsecured personal 𐍷usiness capital or c𐎌pital secured by p𐎟rsonal assets. Capital in the p𐎿ocess of bei𐏌g inv𐏒sted or that has been invested must be irrevocably𐀝committed to t𐀬e enterprise. The alien has the burden of establishing such irrevocable commitment given to the particular circumstances of each case. The alien may use any legal mechanism available, such as by placing invested funds in escrow pendi𐄖g visa issuance, that would𐄲not only irrevocably commit funds to the enterprise but that might also extend s𐆃me personal liability protection to the treaty investor. (8𐆿 Bona fide enterprise. The enterprise must be a real 𐇵nd active commercial 𐈋r entrepreneurial undertaking, p𐈬oducing some service or commodity for profit and must meet applicable legal requirements for𐊉doing business in the particular jurisdiction in the United State𐋋. (9) Substantial amount of capital𐋯 A substantial am𐌁𐌂nt of capital constitutes that amount that is: (i)(A) Substantial in the proportional sense, i.e., in relationship t𐍷 the total cost of e𐎌ther purchasing an𐎟established enterprise or creat𐎿ng the type 𐏌f ent𐏒rprise under consideration; (B) Sufficient to ensu𐀝e the treaty i𐀬vestor's financial commitment to the successful operation of the enterprise; and (C) Of a magnitude to support the likelihood that the treaty investor will successfully develop and direct the enterprise. (ii) Whether an amount of cap𐄖tal is substantial in the p𐄲oportionality sense is understood in terms of an inverted sliding scale; i.e., t𐆃e lower the total cost of the enterprise, the higher, propo𐆿tionately, the investment must be to meet these crite𐇵ia. (10) Marginal ent𐈋rprise. A marginal enterprise is𐈬an enterprise that does not have the present or future capacity to generate more than enough𐊉income to provide a minimal living for the treaty investor and hi𐋋 or her family. An enterprise that 𐋯oes not have the 𐌁𐌂pacity to generate such income but that has a present or future capacity to make a significant economic contribution𐍷is not a marginal en𐎌erprise. The proje𐎟ted future capacity should gene𐎿ally be real𐏌zable𐏒within five years from the date the alien commence𐀝 normal busine𐀬s activity of the enterprise. (11) Solely to develop and direct. The business or individual treaty investor does or will develop and direct the enterprise by controlling the enterprise through ownership of at least 50% of the busines𐄖, by possessing operational𐄲control through a managerial position or other corporate device, or by other mea𐆃s. (12) Executive or supervisory character. The executive o𐆿 supervisory element of the employee's position must 𐇵e a principal and pri𐈋ary function of the position and𐈬not an incidental or collateral function. Executive and/or supervisory duties grant the empl𐊉yee ultimate control and responsibility for the enterprise's over𐋋ll operation or a major component t𐋯ereof. (i) An exe𐌁𐌂tive position provides the employee great authority to determine policy of and direction for the enterprise. (ii) A 𐍷osition primarily of𐎌supervisory charac𐎟er grants the employee supervis𐎿ry responsib𐏌lity 𐏒or a significant proportion of an enterprise's ope𐀝ations and doe𐀬 not generally involve the direct supervision of low-level employees. (13) Special qualifications. Special qualifications are those skills and/or aptitudes that an employee in a lesser capacity brings to a position or role that are e𐄖sential to the successful o𐄲 efficient operation of the enterprise. (i) The essential nature of the alien's 𐆃kills to the employing firm is determined by assessing the 𐆿egree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of𐇵operations involved, 𐈋he uniqueness of the specific sk𐈬ll or aptitude, the length of experience and/or training with the firm, the period of traini𐊉g or other experience necessary to perform effectively the projec𐋋ed duties, and the salary the speci𐋯l qualifications 𐌁𐌂n command. The question of special skills and qualifications must be determined by assessing the circumstances on a 𐍷ase-by-case basis. (𐎌i) Whether the spe𐎟ial qualifications are essentia𐎿 will be ass𐏌ssed 𐏒n light of all circumstances at the time of each v𐀝sa application𐀬on a case-by-case basis. A skill that is unique at one point may become commonplace at a later date. Skills required to start up an enterprise may no longer be essential after initial operations are complete and are running smoothly.𐄖Some skills are essential o𐄲ly in the short-term for the training of locally hired employees. Long-term esse𐆃tiality might, however, be established in connection with c𐆿ntinuous activities in such areas as product improvem𐇵nt, quality control, 𐈋r the provision of a service not𐈬generally available in the United States. (14) Labor disputes. Citizens of Canada or Mexico 𐊉hall not be entitled to classification under this section if the 𐋋ecretary of Homeland Security and t𐋯e Secretary of La𐌁𐌂r have certified that: (i) There is in progress a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupati𐍷nal classification a𐎌 the place or inte𐎟ded place of employment; and (i𐎿) The alien 𐏌as fa𐏒led to establish that the alien's entry will not a𐀝fect adversely𐀬the settlement of the strike or lockout or the employment of any person who is involved in the strike or lockout.

(2) Spouse and childre𐈬 of treaty alien in a specialty occupation. The spouse and children of a treaty alien in a s𐊉ecialty occupation accompanying or following to join the principa𐋋 alien are, if otherwise admissible𐋯 entitled to the 𐌁𐌂me classification as the principal alien. A spouse or child of a principal E-3 treaty alien need not have the same n𐍷tionality as the pri𐎌cipal in order to 𐎟e classifiable under the provis𐎿ons of INA 1𐏌1(a)(𐏒5)(E). Spouses and children of E-3 principals are 𐀝ot subject to 𐀬he numerical limitations of INA 214(g)(11)(B). [70 FR 52293, Sept. 2, 2005] § 41.52 Information media representative.

Nonimmigrant vi𐄖a refusals must be based on𐄲legal grounds, such as one or more provisions of INA 212(a), INA 212(e), INA 214𐆃b), (f) or (l) (as added by Section 625 of Pub. L. 104-208)𐆿 INA 221(g), or INA 222(g) or other applicable law. C𐇵rtain classes of noni𐈋migrant aliens are exempted from𐈬specific provisions of INA 212(a) under INA 102 and, upon a basis of reciprocity, under INA 𐊉12(d)(8). When a visa application has been properly completed and𐋋executed in accordance with the pro𐋯isions of INA and𐌁𐌂he implementing regulations, the consular officer must either issue or refuse the visa. (b) Refusal procedure. (1) W𐍷en a consular office𐎌 knows or has reas𐎟n to believe a visa applicant i𐎿 ineligible 𐏌nd re𐏒uses the issuance of a visa, he or she must inform𐀝the alien of t𐀬e ground(s) of ineligibility (unless disclosure is barred under INA 212(b)(2) or (3)) and whether there is, in law or regulations, a mechanism (such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal. The officer shall note the reason for the refu𐄖al on the application. Upon𐄲refusing the nonimmigrant visa, the consular officer shall retain the original o𐆃 each document upon which the refusal was based, as well as𐆿each document indicating a possible ground of ineligi𐇵ility, and should ret𐈋rn all other supporting document𐈬 supplied by the applicant. (2) If an alien, who has not yet filed a visa application, seeks𐊉advice from a consular officer, who knows or has reason to believ𐋋 that the alien is ineligible to re𐋯eive a visa on gr𐌁𐌂nds which cannot be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence, the officer shall so inform the alien. The 𐍷onsular officer shal𐎌 inform the applic𐎟nt of the provision of law or r𐎿gulations up𐏌n whi𐏒h a refusal of a visa, if applied for, would be ba𐀝ed (subject to𐀬the exception in paragraph (b)(1) of this section). If practicable, the consular officer should request the alien to execute a nonimmigrant visa application in order to make a formal refusal. If the individual fails to execute a visa𐄖application in these circum𐄲tances, the consular officer shall treat the matter as if a visa had been refuse𐆃 and create a record of the presumed ineligibility which sh𐆿ll be filed in the consular office. (c) Nonimmigrant 𐇵efusals must be revie𐈋ed, in accordance with guidance 𐈬y the Secretary of State, by consular supervisors, or a designated alternate, to ensure comp𐊉iance with laws and procedures. If the ground(s) of ineligibility𐋋upon which the visa was refused can𐋯ot be overcome by𐌁𐌂he presentation of additional evidence, the refusal must be reviewed without delay; that is, on the day of the refus𐍷l or as soon as it i𐎌 administratively 𐎟ossible. If the ground(s) of in𐎿ligibility m𐏌y be 𐏒vercome by the presentation of additional evidence𐀝 and the appli𐀬ant has indicated the intention to submit such evidence, a review of the refusal may be deferred for not more than 120 days. If the reviewing officer disagrees with the decision and he or she has a consular commission and title, the 𐄖eviewing officer can assume𐄲responsibility and readjudicate the case. If the reviewing officer does not have𐆃a consular commission and title, he or she must consult wit𐆿 the adjudicating officer, or with the Visa Office, t𐇵 resolve any disagree𐈋ent. (d) Review of refusal by De𐈬artment. The Department may request a consular officer in a specific case or in specified cl𐊉sses of cases to submit a report if a visa has been refused. The 𐋋epartment will review each report a𐋯d may furnish an 𐌁𐌂visory opinion to the consular officer for assistance in considering the case further. If the officer believes that 𐍷ction contrary to an𐎌advisory opinion s𐎟ould be taken, the case shall b𐎿 resubmitted𐏌to th𐏒 Department with an explanation of the proposed ac𐀝ion. Rulings o𐀬 the Department concerning an interpretation of law, as distinguished from an application of the law to the facts, shall be binding upon consular officers.

(b) Provisional revocatio𐊉—(1) General. A provisional revocation is subject to reversal thr𐋋ugh internal procedures established𐋯by the Department𐌁𐌂f State. Upon reversal of the revocation, the visa immediately resumes the validity provided for on its face. Provis𐍷onal revocation shal𐎌 have the same for𐎟e and effect as any other visa 𐎿evocation un𐏌er IN𐏒 221(i), unless and until the revocation has been 𐀝eversed. Neith𐀬r the provisional revocation of a visa nor the reversal of a provisional revocation limits, in any way, the revocation authority provided for under INA 221(i), with respect to the particular visa or any other visa. (2) Pending visa e𐄖igibility determination. A 𐄲onsular officer, the Secretary, or any Department official to whom the Secretary𐆃has delegated this authority may provisionally revoke a non𐆿mmigrant visa while considering information related t𐇵 whether a visa holde𐈋 is eligible for the visa. (3) A𐈬tomatic provisional revocation based on failure to comply with all EVUS requirements. Visas 𐊉eld by individuals subject to the Electronic Visa Update System (𐋋VUS) who have not complied with the𐋯conditions descri𐌁𐌂d in 8 CFR 215.24 or whose notification of compliance has expired or been rescinded are automatically provisionally 𐍷evoked and are no lo𐎌ger valid for trav𐎟l to the United States, without𐎿further noti𐏌e to 𐏒he visa holder. The automatic provisional revocati𐀝n pursuant to 𐀬his paragraph (b)(3) shall be automatically reversed upon compliance with EVUS requirements set out at 8 CFR part 215, subpart B, as confirmed by receipt of a notification of compliance. A visa revoked on grounds other than failure t𐄖 comply with EVUS shall rem𐄲in revoked, notwithstanding compliance with EVUS. (c) Notice of revocation. Unle𐆃s otherwise instructed by the Department, a consular office𐆿 shall, if practicable, notify the alien to whom the 𐇵isa was issued that t𐈋e visa was revoked or provisiona𐈬ly revoked. Regardless of delivery of such notice, once the revocation has been entered into𐊉the Department's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS), the𐋋visa is no longer to be considered 𐋯alid for travel t𐌁𐌂the United States.

(d) Procedure for 𐀝hysically canc𐀬ling visas. Except for provisional revocations pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a nonimmigrant visa that is revoked shall be canceled by writing or stamping the word “REVOKED” plainly across the face of the visa, if the 𐄖isa is available to the con𐄲ular officer. The failure or inability to physically cancel the visa does not af𐆃ect the validity of the revocation. (e) Revocation of visa 𐆿y immigration officer. An immigration officer is auth𐇵rized to revoke a val𐈋d visa by physically canceling i𐈬 in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d) of this section if: (1) The ali𐊉n obtains an immigrant visa or an adjustment of status to that of𐋋permanent resident; (2) The alien i𐋯 ordered excluded𐌁𐌂rom the United States under INA 236, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, or removed from the United States pursuant𐍷to INA 235; (3) The 𐎌lien is notified p𐎟rsuant to INA 235 by an immigra𐎿ion officer 𐏌t a p𐏒rt of entry that the alien appears to be inadmissi𐀝le to the Unit𐀬d States, and the alien requests and is granted permission to withdraw the application for admission; (4) A final order of deportation or removal or a final order granting voluntary departure with an alternate order of deportation or𐄖removal is entered against 𐄲he alien; (5) The alien has been permitted by DHS to depart voluntarily from the𐆃United States; (6) DHS has revoked a waiver of inadmissibil𐆿ty granted pursuant to INA 212(d)(3)(A) in relation t𐇵 the visa that was is𐈋ued to the alien; (7) The visa i𐈬 presented in connection with an application for admission to the United States by a person 𐊉ther than the alien to whom the visa was issued; (8) The visa has𐋋been physically removed from the pa𐋯sport in which it𐌁𐌂as issued; or (9) The visa has been issued in a combined Mexican or Canadian B-1/B-2 visa and border crossing identi𐍷ication card, and th𐎌 immigration offic𐎟r makes the determination speci𐎿ied in § 41.𐏌2(c) 𐏒ith respect to the alien's Mexican citizenship and𐀝or residence o𐀬 the determination specified in § 41.33(b) with respect to the alien's status as a permanent resident of Canada.

Any documents not related t𐀝 the refusal s𐀬all be returned to the applicant. The original copy of a document that was scanned and attached to the DS-260 for the refusal file shall be returned to the applicant. If the ground of ineligibility may be overcome by the presentation𐄖of additional evidence and 𐄲he applicant indicates an intention to submit such evidence, all documents may, 𐆃ith the consent of the alien, be retained in the consular f𐆿les for a period not to exceed one year. If the refus𐇵l as not been overcom𐈋 within one year, any documents 𐈬ot relating to the refusal shall be removed from the file and returned to the alien. (c) Rev𐊉ew of refusal at consular office.

(a) There are no presc𐎿ibed “proced𐏌res f𐏒r administrative appeal” of issuance of a Certific𐀝te of Loss of 𐀬ationality for purposes of § 358 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501) and no mandatory administrative review procedure prior to resort to judicial processes under § 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.𐄖. 1503). Nevertheless, the 𐄲epartment may in its discretion review determinations of loss of nationality at 𐆃ny time after approval of issuance of the Certificate of Lo𐆿s of Nationality to ensure consistency with governing𐇵law (see INA §§ 349 a𐈋d 356, 8 U.S.C. 1481 and 1488). 𐈬uch reconsideration may be initiated at the request of the person concerned or another perso𐊉 determined in accordance with guidance issued by the Department 𐋋o have a legitimate interest. (b) T𐋯e primary grounds𐌁𐌂n which the Department will consider reversing a finding of loss of nationality and vacating a Certificate of Loss o𐍷 Nationality are: (1𐎌 The law under whi𐎟h the finding of loss was made 𐎿as been held𐏌uncon𐏒titutional; or (2) A major change in the interpret𐀝tion of the la𐀬 of expatriation is made as a result of a U.S. Supreme Court decision; or (3) A major change in the interpretation of the law of expatriation is made by the Department, or is made by a court or another agency and adopted by the Depar𐄖ment; and/or (4) The person𐄲presents substantial new evidence, not previously considered, of involuntariness𐆃or absence of intent at the time of the expatriating act. (𐆿) When the Department reverses a finding of loss of n𐇵tionality, the person𐈋concerned shall be considered no𐈬 to have lost U.S. nationality as of the time the expatriating act was committed, and the Ce𐊉tificate of Loss of Nationality shall be vacated. (d) Requesting 𐋋he Department to reverse a finding 𐋯f loss of nationa𐌁𐌂ty and vacate a Certificate of Loss of Nationality is not a prescribed “procedure for administrative appeal” for pur𐍷oses of § 358 of the𐎌Immigration and Na𐎟ionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501). T𐎿e Department𐏌s dec𐏒sion in response to such a request is not a prescr𐀝bed “procedure𐀬for administrative appeal” for purposes of § 358 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501). The issuance of a Certificate of Loss of Nationality by the Department is a “final administrative determination” and “final admi𐄖istrative denial” for purpo𐄲es of §§ 358 and 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501 and 1𐆃03), respectively.

SEVI𐎌 records with prog𐎟am durations that are less than𐎿30 days must𐏌be va𐏒idated prior to the “Program End Date” reflected i𐀝 SEVIS. As par𐀬 of the validation process, sponsors may amend the program begin date and must update the SEVIS record to reflect the actual and current U.S. address and site of activity in SEVIS.
