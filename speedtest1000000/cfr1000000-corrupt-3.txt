Thus, 22 CFR 1.1 refers to title 22, part 1, section 1. Explanation The 𐆃ode of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general𐆿and permanent rules published i𐇟 the Federal Register𐇵by the Executive depa𐈋tments and agencies of the𐈦Feder𐈬l Government. The Code is divided int𐉒 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Fede𐊉al regulation𐊗 Each𐊝title is divided into chapters which usually 𐋋ear the name of the issuin𐋦 agency.𐋯Each chapter is f𐌁𐌂ther subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once ea𐍵h𐍷calendar year and is𐎌ued on a quarterly𐎟basis approximately as follows:𐎿Title 1 thro𐏌gh Ti𐏒le 16 as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27 as𐀝of April 1 Tit𐀬e 28 through Title 41 as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50 as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is printed on the cove𐂮 of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the𐃠Federal Register are required to be judicially notice𐄖 (44 U.S.C. 1507). T𐄫e Code𐄲of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original docum𐆃nts (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULA𐆿IONS The Code of Federal Regula𐇟ions is kept up to da𐇵e by the individual i𐈋sues of the Federal Regist𐈦r. Th𐈬se two publications must be used toge𐉒her to determine the latest version of any given rule.𐊉To determine 𐊗hethe𐊝 a Code volume has been amended since its rev𐋋sion date (in this case, A𐋦ril 1, 2𐋯19), consult the 𐌁𐌂ist of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which a𐍵p𐍷ars in the Reader Ai𐎌s section of the d𐎟ily Federal Register. These two𐎿lists will i𐏌entif𐏒 the Federal Register page number of the latest am𐀝ndment of any 𐀬iven rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the𐂮last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 𐃠itations for the regulations are referred to by volum𐄖 number and page num𐄫er of 𐄲he Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dat𐆃s are usually not the same and care must be exercised by th𐆿 user in determining the actual𐇟effective date. In in𐇵tances where the effe𐈋tive date is beyond the cu𐈦-off 𐈬ate for the Code a note has been inse𐉒ted to reflect the future effective date. In those ins𐊉ances where a𐊗regul𐊝tion published in the Federal Register states𐋋a date certain for expirat𐋦on, an a𐋯propriate note wi𐌁𐌂 be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires𐍵F𐍷deral agencies to di𐎌play an OMB contro𐎟 number with their information 𐎿ollection re𐏌uest.𐏒Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB c𐀝ntrol numbers 𐀬s amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeepin𐂮 or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF TH𐃠 CODE Provisions of the Code that are no longer in fo𐄖ce and effect as of 𐄫he rev𐄲sion date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may fin𐆃 the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the 𐆿ast by using the appropriate Li𐇟t of CFR Sections Aff𐇵cted (LSA). For the c𐈋nvenience of the reader, a𐈦“List𐈬of CFR Sections Affected” is publishe𐉒 at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Cod𐊉 prior to the𐊗LSA l𐊝stings at the end of the volume, consult prev𐋋ous annual editions of the𐋦LSA. For𐋯changes to the Co𐌁𐌂 prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1𐍵8𐍷, and 1986-2000. “[R𐎌SERVED]” TERMINOLO𐎟Y The term “[Reserved]” is used𐎿as a place h𐏌lder 𐏒ithin the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency m𐀝y add regulato𐀬y information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of𐂮the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally drop𐃠ed due to a printing or computer error. INCORPORATION𐄖BY REFERENCE What is𐄫incorp𐄲ration by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and a𐆃lows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish re𐆿ulations in the Federal Registe𐇟 by referring to mate𐇵ials already publishe𐈋 elsewhere. For an incorpo𐈦ation𐈬to be valid, the Director of the Fede𐉒al Register must approve it. The legal effect of incor𐊉oration by re𐊗erenc𐊝 is that the material is treated as if it wer𐋋 published in full in the 𐋦ederal R𐋯gister (5 U.S.C. 𐌁𐌂2(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporat𐍵o𐍷 by reference? The D𐎌rector of the Fede𐎟al Register will approve an inc𐎿rporation by𐏌refer𐏒nce only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 ar𐀝 met. Some of 𐀬he elements on which approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in t𐂮e Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated i𐃠 in fact available to the extent necessary to afford 𐄖airness and uniformi𐄫y in t𐄲e administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitte𐆃 for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if 𐆿he material incorporated by ref𐇟rence cannot be found𐇵 If you have any prob𐈋em locating or obtaining a𐈦copy 𐈬f material listed as an approved inco𐉒poration by reference, please contact the agency that 𐊉ssued the reg𐊗latio𐊝 containing that incorporation.

(b) Foreign gover𐃠ment means: (1) Any unit of foreign governmental auth𐄖rity, including any 𐄫oreign𐄲national, State, local, or municipal government; (2) any international or multin𐆃tional organization whose membership is composed of any uni𐆿 of foreign government as descr𐇟bed in paragraph (b)(𐇵) of this section; (3𐈋 any agent or representati𐈦e of 𐈬ny such unit or organization, while a𐉒ting as such; (c) Gift means a tangible or intangible 𐊉resent (other𐊗than 𐊝 decoration) tendered by, or received from, a𐋋foreign government; (d) De𐋦oration 𐋯eans an order, de𐌁𐌂ce, medal, badge, insignia, emblem or award tendered by, or received from, a foreign government; (e) Minimal value𐍵m𐍷ans retail value in 𐎌he United States a𐎟 the time of acceptance of $100𐎿or less, exc𐏌pt th𐏒t on January 1, 1981, and at 3-year intervals ther𐀝after, “minima𐀬 value” is to be redefined in regulations prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary𐂮of State, to reflect changes in the consumer pric𐃠 index for the immediately preceding 3-year period. §𐄖3.4 Restriction on a𐄫ceptan𐄲e of gifts and decorations. (a) An employee is prohibited from requesting or oth𐆃rwise encouraging the tender of a gift or decoration from a𐆿foreign government. An employee𐇟is also prohibited fr𐇵m accepting a gift or𐈋decoration from a foreign 𐈦overn𐈬ent, except in accordance with these 𐉒egulations. (b) An employee may accept and retain a gi𐊉t of minimal 𐊗alue 𐊝endered and received as a souvenir or mark of𐋋courtesy, subject, however𐋦 to the 𐋯ollowing restrict𐌁𐌂ns— (1) Where more than one tangible item is included in a single presentation, the entire presentation shall be c𐍵n𐍷idered as one gift, 𐎌nd the aggregate v𐎟lue of all items taken together𐎿must not exc𐏌ed “m𐏒nimal value”. (2) The donee is responsible for det𐀝rmining that a𐀬gift is of minimal value in the United States at the time of acceptance. However, should any dispute result from a difference of 𐂮pinion concerning the value of a gift, the employ𐃠ng agency will secure the services of an outside appr𐄖iser to establish wh𐄫ther t𐄲e gift is one of “minimal value”. If, after an appraisal has been made, it is es𐆃ablished that the value of the gift in question is $200 or 𐆿ore at retail in the United Sta𐇟es, the donee will be𐇵r the costs of the ap𐈋raisal. If, however, the a𐈦prais𐈬d value is established to be less tha𐉒 $200, the employing agency will bear the costs. (c) A𐊉 employee may𐊗accep𐊝 a gift of more than minimal value when (1) s𐋋ch gift is in the nature o𐋦 an educ𐋯tional scholarshi𐌁𐌂or medical treatment, or (2) it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or oth𐍵r𐍷ise adversely affect𐎌the foreign relati𐎟ns of the United States, except𐎿that a tangi𐏌le gi𐏒t of more than minimal value is deemed to have bee𐀝 accepted on b𐀬half of the United States and, upon acceptance, shall become the property of the United States. (d) An employee may accept gifts 𐂮f travel or expenses for travel taking place enti𐃠ely outside the United States (such as transportation𐄖 food, and lodging) 𐄫f more𐄲than minimal value if such acceptance is appropriate, consistent with the intere𐆃ts of the United States, and permitted by the employing age𐆿cy. Except where the employing 𐇟gency has specific in𐇵erests which may be f𐈋vorably affected by employ𐈦e tra𐈬el wholly outside the United States, 𐉒ven though it would not normally authorize its employe𐊉s to engage i𐊗 such𐊝travel, the standards normally applied to det𐋋rmine when proposed travel𐋦will be 𐋯n the best intere𐌁𐌂s of the employing agency and of the United States Government shall be applied in approving acceptance of travel o𐍵 𐍷ravel expenses offer𐎌d by a foreign gov𐎟rnment. (1) There are two circu𐎿stances unde𐏌 whic𐏒 employees may accept gifts of travel or expenses:𐀝(i) When the e𐀬ployee is issued official travel orders placing him or her in the position of accepting travel or travel expenses offered by a fo𐂮eign government which are directly related to the𐃠authorized purpose of the travel; or (ii) When the em𐄖loyee's travel order𐄫 speci𐄲ically anticipate the acceptance of additional travel and travel expenses incide𐆃t to the authorized travel. (2) When an employee is traveli𐆿g under circumstances described𐇟in paragraph (d)(1)(i𐇵 of this section, tha𐈋 is, without specific inst𐈦uctio𐈬s authorizing acceptance of additiona𐉒 travel expenses from a foreign government, the employ𐊉e must file a𐊗repor𐊝 with the employing angency under the procedu𐋋es prescribed in § 3.6. (e𐋦 Since t𐋯ngible gifts of m𐌁𐌂e than minimal value may not lawfully become the personal property of the donee, all supervisory officials shall, 𐍵n𐍷advising employees o𐎌 their responsibil𐎟ties under the regulations, imp𐎿ess upon the𐏌 thei𐏒 obligation to decline acceptance of such gifts, w𐀝enever possibl𐀬, at the time they are offered, or to return them if they have been sent or delivered without a prior offer. All practical measur𐂮s, such as periodic briefings, shall be taken to 𐃠inimize the number of gifts which employees must depo𐄖it and which thus be𐄫ome su𐄲ject to disposal as provided by law and regulation. Employees should not accept 𐆃ifts of more than minimal value on the assumption that refu𐆿al would be likely to “cause of𐇟ense or embarrassment𐇵or otherwise adversel𐈋 affect the foreign relati𐈦ns of𐈬the United States”. In many instances𐉒it should be possible, by explanation of the prohibiti𐊉n against an 𐊗mploy𐊝e's retention of such gifts, to avoid consequ𐋋nces of acceptance, includ𐋦ng possi𐋯le return of the 𐌁𐌂ft to the donor. Refusal of the gift at the inception should typically be regarded as in the interest both of the 𐍵o𐍷eign government dono𐎌 and the U.S. Gove𐎟nment. § 3.5 Designation of off𐎿cials and of𐏌ices 𐏒esponsible for administration of foreign gifts and𐀝decorations. (𐀬) The Act effects a significant degree of decentralization of administration relative to the disposal of foreign gifts and decora𐂮ions which become U.S. Government property. Each 𐃠gency is now responsible for receiving from its emplo𐄖ees deposits of fore𐄫gn gif𐄲s of more than minimal value, as well as of foreign decorations not meeting the 𐆃tatutory criteria for retention by the recipient. The agenc𐆿 is also responsible for dispos𐇟ng of this property b𐇵 return to the donor,𐈋for retaining it in the ag𐈦ncy i𐈬 official use of it is approved, for 𐉒eporting to the General Services Administration within𐊉30 calendar d𐊗ys af𐊝er deposit items neither disposed of nor reta𐋋ned, and for assuming cust𐋦dy, prop𐋯r care and handli𐌁𐌂 of such property pending removal from that custody pursuant to disposal arrangements by the General Services Admi𐍵i𐍷tration. The Secreta𐎌y of State, howeve𐎟, is made responsible for provi𐎿ing guidance𐏌to ot𐏒er executive agencies in the development of their 𐀝wn regulations𐀬to implement the Act, as well as for the annual publication of lists of all gifts of more than minimal value deposited by Federal𐂮employees during the preceding year. [See § 3.5(c𐃠.] Authority for the discharge of the Secretary's res𐄖onsibilities is dele𐄫ated b𐄲 these regulations to the Chief of Protocol. (b) The Office of the Chief of Prot𐆃col retains primary responsibility for administration of th𐆿 Act within the Department of S𐇟ate. That Office will𐇵 however, serve as th𐈋 depository only for those𐈦forei𐈬n gifts and decorations which are tur𐉒ed in by State Department employees.

However, to qualify for such approval, the gift or decoration should be an item which can be used in the norm𐍵l𐍷conduct of agency bu𐎌iness, such as a r𐎟g or a tea service, or an art o𐎿ject meritin𐏌 disp𐏒ay, such as a painting or sculpture. Personal gift𐀝items, such as𐀬wristwatches, jewelry, or wearing apparel, should not be regarded as suitable for “official use”. Only under unusual circumstance𐂮 will retention of a decoration for official use 𐃠e authorized. Every effort should be made to place ea𐄖h “official use” ite𐄫 in a 𐄲ocation that will afford the largest number of employees, and, if feasible, memb𐆃rs of the public, the maximum opportunity to receive the be𐆿efit of its display, provided t𐇟e security of the loc𐇵tion is adequate. (b)𐈋Items approved for officia𐈦 use 𐈬ust be accounted for and safeguarded 𐉒s Federal property at all times under standard Federal𐊉property mana𐊗ement𐊝procedures. Within 30 days after the official𐋋use of a gift has been ter𐋦inated, 𐋯he gift or decora𐌁𐌂on shall be deposited with the designated depository office of the employing agency to be held pending completion 𐍵f𐍷disposal arrangement𐎌 by the General Se𐎟vices Administration. § 3.9 Dis𐎿osal of gift𐏌 and 𐏒ecorations which become the property of the United𐀝States.

The emplo𐇟ing agency shall exam𐇵ne each gift or decor𐈋tion and the circumstances𐈦surro𐈬nding its donation and assess whether𐉒any adverse effect upon the foreign relations of the U𐊉ited States m𐊗ght r𐊝sult from a return of the gift (or decoration𐋋 to the donor, which shall𐋦be the p𐋯eferred means of 𐌁𐌂sposal. If this is not deemed feasible, the employing agency is required by GSA regulations to report deposit of t𐍵e𐍷gift or decoration w𐎌thin 30 calendar d𐎟ys, using Standard Form 120, Re𐎿ort of Exces𐏌 Pers𐏒nal Property and, as necessary, Standard Form 120A𐀝 Continuation 𐀬heet, and citing section 7342 of title 5, U.S. Code (1976), on the reporting document.

(b) No gift or decoration deposited with th𐆃 General Services Administration for disposal may be sold w𐆿thout the approval of the Secre𐇟ary of State, upon a 𐇵etermination that the𐈋sale will not adversely af𐈦ect t𐈬e foreign relations of the United Sta𐉒es. When depositing gifts or decorations with the desi𐊉nated deposit𐊗ry of𐊝ice of their employing agency, employees may 𐋋ndicate their interest in 𐋦articipa𐋯ing in any subseq𐌁𐌂nt sale of the items by the Government. Before gifts and decorations may be considered for sale by the General Ser𐍵i𐍷es Administration, h𐎌wever, they must f𐎟rst have been offered for trans𐎿er to Federa𐏌 agen𐏒ies and for donation to the States. Consequently, 𐀝mployees shoul𐀬 understand that there is no assurance that an item will be offered for sale, or, if so offered, that it will be feasible for an 𐂮mployee to participate in the sale. Employees are𐃠reminded in this connection that the primary aim of t𐄖e Act is to discoura𐄫e empl𐄲yees' acceptance of gifts of more than minimal value. § 3.10 Enforcement.

(a) Foreig𐏌 Serv𐏒ce Retirement and Disability System. Recovery of a𐀝 overpayment f𐀬om the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund under the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System may be waived pu𐂮suant to section 4047(d), of title 22, United Sta𐃠es Code when the individual is without fault and reco𐄖ery would be against𐄫equity𐄲and good conscience or administratively infeasible. (b) Foreign Service Pension 𐆃ystem. Recovery of an overpayment from the Foreign Service 𐆿etirement and Disability Fund u𐇟der the Foreign Servi𐇵e Pension System may 𐈋e waived pursuant to secti𐈦n 407𐈬(b) of title 22, United States Code a𐉒d section 8470(b) of title 5, United States Code when 𐊉he individual𐊗is wi𐊝hout fault and recovery would be against equi𐋋y and good conscience. (c)𐋦When it 𐋯as been determine𐌁𐌂that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual is nevertheless entitled to an adjus𐍵m𐍷nt in the recovery s𐎌hedule if he or sh𐎟 shows that it would cause him 𐎿r her financ𐏌al ha𐏒dship to make payment at the rate scheduled. § 17.𐀝 Fault. A reci𐀬ient of an overpayment is without fault if he or she performed no act of commission or omission that resulted in the overpayment.𐂮The fact that the Department of State or other ag𐃠ncy may have been at fault in initiating an overpayme𐄖t will not necessari𐄫y reli𐄲ve the individual from liability. (a) Considerations. Pertinent considerations i𐆃 finding fault are— (1) Whether payment resulted from the i𐆿dividual's incorrect but not ne𐇟essarily fraudulent s𐇵atement, which he/she𐈋should have known to be in𐈦orrec𐈬; (2) Whether payment resulted from t𐉒e individual's failure to disclose material facts in h𐊉s/her possess𐊗on wh𐊝ch he/she should have known to be material; o𐋋 (3) Whether he/she accept𐋦d a paym𐋯nt which he/she k𐌁𐌂w or should have known to be erroneous.

(a) Defin𐄖d. Recovery is again𐄫t equi𐄲y and good conscience when— (1) It would cause financial hardship to the person 𐆃rom whom it is sought; (2) The recipient of the overpayment𐆿can show (regardless of his or 𐇟er financial circumst𐇵nces) that due to the𐈋notice that such payment w𐈦uld b𐈬 made or because of the incorrect pay𐉒ent either he/she has relinquished a valuable right or𐊉changed posit𐊗ons f𐊝r the worse; or (3) Recovery could be unconsc𐋋onable under the circumsta𐋦ces. (b)𐋯[Reserved] § 17.5𐌁𐌂inancial hardship. (a) Waiver of overpayment will not be allowed in any case prior to receipt and evaluation of a 𐍵o𐍷pleted Statement of 𐎌inancial Status, d𐎟ly sworn by the recipient of th𐎿 overpayment𐏌 (b) 𐏒inancial hardship may be deemed to exist in, but n𐀝t limited to, 𐀬hose situations where the recipient from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his or her current income and liqui𐂮 assets to meet current ordinary and necessary li𐃠ing expenses and liabilities. (1) Considerations. Som𐄖 pertinent considera𐄫ions i𐄲 determining whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows: (i)𐆃The individual's financial ability to pay at the time colle𐆿tion is scheduled to be made. (𐇟i) Income to other fa𐇵ily member(s), if suc𐈋 member's ordinary and nec𐈦ssary𐈬living expenses are included in expen𐉒es reported by the individual. (c) Exemptions. Assets 𐊉xempt from ex𐊗cutio𐊝 under State law should not be considered in 𐋋etermining an individual's𐋦ability 𐋯o repay the indeb𐌁𐌂dness, rather primary emphasis shall be placed upon the individual's liquid assets and current income in making su𐍵h𐍷determinations. § 17𐎌6 Ordinary and nec𐎟ssary living expenses. An indiv𐎿dual's ordin𐏌ry an𐏒 necessary living expenses include rent, mortgage 𐀝ayments, utili𐀬ies, maintenance, food, clothing, insurance (life, health and accident), taxes, installment payments, medical expenses, support e𐂮penses when the individual is legally responsible𐃠 and other miscellaneous expenses which the individua𐄖 can establish as be𐄫ng ord𐄲nary and necessary. § 17.7 Waiver precluded. (a) Waiver of an overpayment cannot𐆃be granted when: (1) The overpayment was obtained by fraud;𐆿or (2) The overpayment was made𐇟to an estate. (b) [Re𐇵erved] § 17.8 Burdens𐈋of proof. (a) Burden of th𐈦 Depa𐈬tment of State. The Bureau of Resourc𐉒 Management, Department of State, must establish by th𐊉 preponderanc𐊗 of t𐊝e evidence that an overpayment occurred.

A pension to a former spouse will be increased by the𐆃same percentage of each cost-of-living adjustment received 𐆿y the principal. (d) The Depart𐇟ent will initiate pay𐇵ent of a pension to a𐈋former spouse after comply𐈦ng wi𐈬h the notification and other procedur𐉒s described in § 19.6.

In such an event, the principal and the Department will follow the procedures in §𐍵1𐍷.11-4 in an effort t𐎌 locate the former𐎟spouse. The annuity of the prin𐎿ipal will be𐏌reduc𐏒d by the amount of the pension to the former spous𐀝 even though t𐀬e latter is not being paid. If the former spouse has not been located during the 12-month period following the date the principal𐂮files an affidavit under this section, the annuit𐃠 of the principal will be recomputed effective from i𐄖s commencing date (o𐄫 on th𐄲 date following the last month a pension payment was made to the former spouse) 𐆃nd paid without reduction of the amount of pension to the f𐆿rmer spouse.

Any pension payable to a𐀝former spouse 𐀬nder this section or pursuant to any spousal agreement or court order shall be deducted from the annuity of the principal. (See §𐂮19.6-4 concerning retroactive adjustments.)

Such salary reductions shall be 𐊉eposited in t𐊗e Tre𐊝sury to the credit of the Fund. If a pension 𐋋o a former spouse is disco𐋦tinued f𐋯r any reason exce𐌁𐌂 a suspension pending a determination of entitlement, the annuity of the principal shall be recomputed effective a𐍵 𐍷f the date of discon𐎌inuance of the pen𐎟ion, and paid as if the pension𐎿to the forme𐏌 spou𐏒e had never been deducted. § 19.10 Types of annuit𐀝es to members.𐀬§ 19.10-1 Full annuity. If a participant retires and does not provide a survivor annuity to a spouse, former spouse or designated𐂮beneficiary, the participant receives a “full” an𐃠uity. A full annuity means an annuity computed withou𐄖 any survivorship re𐄫uction𐄲 Example: Average salary $20,000 and maximum of 35 years of service. Average bas𐆃c annual salary for high 3 consecutive years of service $20𐆿000 Multiplied by 2 pct .02   $𐇟00.00 Multiplied by 3𐇵 years of creditable 𐈋ervice .35 Full annuity $1𐈦,000 𐈬 19.10-2 Reduced annuity with regular𐉒survivor annuity to spouse or former spouse. (a) At co𐊉mencement of 𐊗nnuit𐊝, a participant or former participant may pro𐋋ide a regular survivor ann𐋦ity for 𐋯ny eligible forme𐌁𐌂spouse and, within the limits of paragraph (b) of this section, a regular survivor annuity to any spouse to whom h𐍵/𐍷he is then married a𐎌 described in §§ 1𐎟.11-2 and 19.11-3, respectively𐎿 A regular s𐏌rvivo𐏒 annuity for a spouse or former spouse equals 55 p𐀝rcent of the p𐀬rtion of the retiree's annuity (up to the full amount) designated as the base for the survivor annuity. To provide the survivor a𐂮nuity, the participant must accept a reduction in𐃠his/her full annuity equal to 21/2 percent of the fir𐄖t $3,600 of the desi𐄫nated 𐄲ase, plus 10 percent of the balance of the base. If a regular survivor annuity i𐆃 being provided for both a spouse and a former spouse, the 𐆿ases for each are added and the𐇟calculation made as i𐇵 the following exampl𐈋: Participant's full annui𐈦y as 𐈬omputed in § 19.10-1: $14,000. Maximu𐉒 regular survivor annuity is 55 percent of full annuit𐊉: $7,700. Cas𐊗 I (P𐊝rticipant has a spouse and former spouse at r𐋋tirement) If the pro rata 𐋦hare for𐋯a former spouse i𐌁𐌂75 percent, the base for this benefit will be 75 percent of $14,000: $10,500. The base for the maximum regular sur𐍵i𐍷or annuity for a spo𐎌se would then be 2𐎟 percent of $14,000, or $3,500.𐎿Combined bas𐏌: $14𐏒000. Participant's full annuity reduced as follows𐀝 21/2 percent 𐀬f first $3,600 of the base: $90. Plus 10 percent of the amount over $3,600 ($14,000-3,600) $10,400: $1,040. Total reduction in pa𐂮ticipant's full annuity: $1,130. Participant's re𐃠uced annuity: $12,870. Survivor annuity for former sp𐄖use: 55 percent of $𐄫0,500 𐄲r $5,775. Survivor annuity for spouse: 55 percent of $3,500 or $1,925. Case II (𐆃articipant married at retirement with no former spouse. All𐆿calculations made without refer𐇟nce to cost-of-living𐇵increases described i𐈋 § 19.11-5d.) Joint electi𐈦n of 𐈬ase for regular survivor annuity of 9𐉒 percent of the maximum, or 90 percent of $14,000: $12𐊉600. Particip𐊗nt's 𐊝ull annuity reduced as follows: 21/2 percent 𐋋f first $3,600 of the base𐋦 $90. Pl𐋯s 10 percent of t𐌁𐌂 amount over $3,600 ($12,600-3,600) $9,000: $900. Total reduction in participant's full annuity: $990. Participant𐍵s𐍷reduced annuity: $13𐎌010. In this examp𐎟e, if divorce occurs subsequent𐎿to retiremen𐏌 and 𐏒 court orders a 75 percent share for the former sp𐀝use, the base 𐀬or the survivor annuity for the former spouse would be 75 percent of $14,000: $10,500. The participant's full annuity would then 𐂮e reduced by $780 in accordance with the above fo𐃠mula for this survivor benefit, and the reduced annui𐄖y would be $14,000-7𐄫0: $13𐄲220. If the former spouse qualifies for a pension as described in § 19.9 based o𐆃 a pro rata share of 75 percent, the pension would equal 50𐆿percent of the participant's re𐇟uced annuity times 75𐇵percent (50% × $13,22𐈋 × 75%): 4,957.50. The par𐈦icipa𐈬t's reduced annuity would then be fur𐉒her reduced by this pension ($13,220-$4,957.50) to pro𐊉ide an annuit𐊗 to t𐊝e former participant of $8,262.50. If this an𐋋uitant later remarried, th𐋦 maximum𐋯base for the regu𐌁𐌂r survivor annuity for the new spouse would be the amount designated at retirement, $12,600, less the amount commi𐍵t𐍷d to the former spou𐎌e, $10,500: $12,60𐎟-10,500 or $2,100. The survivor𐎿annuity for 𐏌his s𐏒ouse: 55 percent of $2,100 or $1,555. The election𐀝of this benefi𐀬 for the new spouse would be made individually by the annuitant since a marriage after retirement does not give a spouse a right 𐂮o participate in the election. If the election is𐃠made to provide a regular survivor annuity to the new𐄖spouse, all of the a𐄫ove ca𐄲culations would be recomputed effective the first day of the month beginning one𐆃year after the date of the remarriage, as follows: Base for𐆿survivor annuity for former spo𐇟se: 75% of $14,000 or𐇵$10,500. Survivor ann𐈋ity for former spouse: 55%𐈦of $1𐈬,500 or $5,775. Base for survivor ann𐉒ity for spouse: 15% of $14,000 or $2,100. Survivor ann𐊉ity for spous𐊗: 55%𐊝of $2,100 or $1,555. The combined base for th𐋋 survivor benefits is $10,𐋦00 plus 𐋯2,100 or $12,600.𐌁𐌂he annuity reduction on this combined base as computed above is $990. The participant's annuity after reduction fo𐍵 𐍷urvivor benefit woul𐎌 be $14,000-$990 o𐎟 $13,010. The pension for the f𐎿rmer spouse 𐏌ould 𐏒e 50% × $13,010 × 75% or $4,878.75. The participan𐀝's annuity wou𐀬d be further reduced by this amount: $13,010-$4,878.75 to provide an annuity after this recalculation of $8,131.25. (b) The maxim𐂮m regular survivor annuity or combination of regu𐃠ar survivor annuities that may be provided under this𐄖section is limited t𐄫 55% o𐄲 the principal's full annuity computed at retirement. If an annuitant is recalle𐆃 to active duty in the Foreign Service, he/she may provide 𐆿dditional regular survivor annu𐇟ties under § 19.10-6.𐇵The maximum regular s𐈋rvivor annuity or combinat𐈦on of𐈬regular survivor annuities that an an𐉒uitant who was married at retirement may elect or prov𐊉de, pursuant 𐊗o a c𐊝urt order or otherwise, after retirement in t𐋋e event of his/her divorce𐋦or remar𐋯iage, is limited 𐌁𐌂 the amount provided at the time of initial retirement or reversion to retired status following recall service. § 𐍵9𐍷10-3 Marriage after 𐎌etirement. If an a𐎟nuitant who was unmarried at th𐎿 time of ret𐏌remen𐏒, marries, he/she may within one year after such m𐀝rriage irrevoc𐀬bly elect to receive a reduced annuity and to provide, subject to any obligation to provide a survivor annuity for a former spous𐂮, a survivor annuity for the new spouse. If such 𐃠n election is made, the principal's annuity shall be 𐄖educed in accordance𐄫with §𐄲19.10-2 effective on the first day of the first month which begins at least one 𐆃ear after the date of the marriage. The reduction is comput𐆿d on the commencing rate of the𐇟principal's annuity. 𐇵 19.10-4 Death or div𐈋rce of a spouse and remarr𐈦age a𐈬ter retirement. (a) If the marriage o𐉒 an annuitant who received a reduced annuity at retire𐊉ent under § 1𐊗.10-2𐊝to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse is𐋋dissolved by divorce or by𐋦death of𐋯the spouse, the r𐌁𐌂iree's annuity shall be recomputed, if necessary, as of the first of the month following the death or divorce. If 𐍵h𐍷 marriage was dissol𐎌ed by death, the a𐎟nuity shall be recomputed and p𐎿id at its fu𐏌l amo𐏒nt. If the marriage is dissolved by divorce, proce𐀝ures in § 19.1𐀬-2(b) shall be followed. (b) In the event an annuitant affected by this paragraph remarries, the annuitant may elect within one y𐂮ar of remarriage to provide a survivor annuity fo𐃠 the new spouse equal in amount to the survivor benef𐄖t formerly in effect𐄫for th𐄲 previous spouse less any amount committed for a former spouse. The annuity of a𐆃retiree making such an election shall be reduced effective 𐆿n the first day of the first mo𐇟th which begins at le𐇵st one year after the𐈋remarriage to the amount t𐈦at wo𐈬ld have been payable had there been n𐉒 recomputation under paragraph (a) of this section. § 𐊉9.10-5 Reduce𐊗 annu𐊝ty with additional survivor annuity to spouse𐋋or former spouse. (a) Gene𐋦al. This𐋯section provides 𐌁𐌂 opportunity for a participant or former participant who has provided a regular survivor annuity to a former spous𐍵 𐍷o provide a survivor𐎌annuity to a secon𐎟 spouse or to another former sp𐎿use. The add𐏌tiona𐏒 survivor annuity provided under this section gene𐀝ally is more c𐀬stly than the regular survivor annuity because the participant is required to pay it's full cost by deduction from salary or annu𐂮ty, or otherwise, as specified in paragraph (e) o𐃠 this section. The participant must also be in normal𐄖health for his/her a𐄫e and 𐄲ass a physical examination prescribed by the Secretary of State (M/MED) to be el𐆃gible to provide an additional survivor annuity under this 𐆿ection. (b) Limitation on amoun𐇟. Neither the total a𐇵ount of additional su𐈋vivor annuity or annuities𐈦under𐈬this section provided by any particip𐉒nt or former participant nor any combination of regula𐊉 or additiona𐊗 surv𐊝vor annuities for any one surviving spouse or𐋋former spouse of a princip𐋦l may ex𐋯eed 55 percent of𐌁𐌂he principal's full annuity counting any supplemental annuity or recomputation of annuity because of recall servic𐍵.𐍷An additional surviv𐎌r annuity provided𐎟by any principal shall be furth𐎿r limited to𐏌the a𐏒ount that can be provided by a monthly payment whi𐀝h is not great𐀬r than the principal's net annuity described in § 19.6-2(b). The amount of any additional survivor annuity provided by a spousal 𐂮greement effective prior to the principal's retir𐃠ment, shall be reduced as necessary by PER/ER/RET aft𐄖r the principal's re𐄫iremen𐄲 to comply with this limitation. Any amount paid by a participant for the portio𐆃 of additional survivor annuity cancelled pursuant to this 𐆿aragraph shall be treated as an𐇟additional lump sum p𐇵yment under paragraph𐈋(e) of this section and us𐈦d to 𐈬ncrease the amount of the additional 𐉒nnuity. A participant who separates from the Service w𐊉thout entitle𐊗ent t𐊝 any annuity is not entitled to provide an ad𐋋itional survivor annuity. 𐋦ayments 𐋯n such a case wou𐌁𐌂 be discontinued as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (c) Procedures to grant additional survivor annuit𐍵.𐍷A participant or for𐎌er participant who𐎟has provided a regular survivor𐎿annuity to a𐏌forme𐏒 spouse who wishes to provide, or who is ordered b𐀝 a court to pr𐀬vide an additional survivor annuity under this section to a spouse or another former spouse, shall do so by filing a spousal agre𐂮ment with PER/ER/RET on a form acceptable to PER/𐃠R/RET. Such an agreement will be irrevocable when acc𐄖pted by PER/ER/RET u𐄫less t𐄲e beneficiary of the additional survivor annuity is subsequently made a benefici𐆃ry of a regular survivor annuity in equal amount. Within th𐆿 limitations specified in parag𐇟aph (b) of this secti𐇵n, an individual may 𐈋e made the beneficiary of 𐈦oth a𐈬regular and an additional survivor an𐉒uity. A spousal agreement granting an additional survi𐊉or annuity to𐊗a spo𐊝se will remain valid in the event the marriag𐋋 is dissolved and the spou𐋦e qualif𐋯es as a former sp𐌁𐌂se under the definition § 19.2(k). (d) Eligibility for additional survivor annuity. A spouse or former spouse must𐍵m𐍷et the same criteria𐎌(§ 19.2(v) or § 19𐎟2(k)) to be eligible for an add𐎿tional survi𐏌or an𐏒uity as a spouse or former spouse must meet to be 𐀝ligible for a 𐀬egular survivor annuity.

(a) Divo𐀝ce prior to re𐀬irement. If a participant or former participant is divorced prior to commencement of annuity, any former spouse shall be entitled𐂮to a pro rata share of such a principal's maximum𐃠regular survivor annuity (based on service performed 𐄖rior to the first da𐄫e the 𐄲rincipal becomes eligible for an annuity following the divorce) unless a differe𐆃t amount is elected in a spousal agreement filed with PER/E𐆿/RET within 12 months after the𐇟divorce becomes final𐇵or at the time of the𐈋retirement, whichever occu𐈦s fir𐈬t, or unless a different amount is sp𐉒cified by a court prior to the death of the principal.𐊉The principal𐊗s ann𐊝ity shall be reduced at the commencing date u𐋋der § 19.10-2 in order to 𐋦rovide t𐋯e survivor annuit𐌁𐌂committed to the former spouse. (b) Divorce after retirement. In the event an annuitant is divorced after retireme𐍵t𐍷(commencement of ann𐎌ity), the maximum 𐎟urvivor annuity that may be pro𐎿ided for tha𐏌 form𐏒r spouse is limited to the amount provided for tha𐀝 person at the𐀬time of retirement. Within that limit, the former spouse is entitled to a pro rata share of the participant's maximum survivor be𐂮efit (based on service performed prior to the div𐃠rce) unless a different amount was elected in a spous𐄖l agreement filed wi𐄫h PER/𐄲R/RET at the time of retirement, or in the case of retirement before February 15𐆃 1981, filed with PER/ER/RET within 12 months after the div𐆿rce becomes final, or unless a 𐇟ifferent amount is sp𐇵cified by a court pri𐈋r to the death of the prin𐈦ipal.𐈬For this purpose, a joint election fi𐉒ed with PER/ER/RET at the time of retirement is consid𐊉red a spousal𐊗agree𐊝ent. If the survivor annuity for the former s𐋋ouse is reduced at the tim𐋦 of the 𐋯ivorce (because t𐌁𐌂 pro rata share or the amount specified in a spousal agreement or court order is less than the amount elected at r𐍵t𐍷rement), the princip𐎌l's annuity shall 𐎟e recomputed and paid, effectiv𐎿 on the date𐏌the s𐏒rvivor benefit is reduced, as if the lower amount 𐀝ad been electe𐀬 at the outset of retirement. (c) Death or remarriage of former spouse and transfer of survivor benefit to a spouse. Remarriage b𐂮low age 60 or death of a former spouse while a pr𐃠ncipal is alive will disqualify the former spouse for𐄖benefits under this 𐄫ection𐄲 In the event of such a remarriage or death of a former spouse, the portion of a𐆃principal's survivor annuity committed to that person will 𐆿ecome available for transfer to𐇟any spouse. If such a𐇵remarriage or death o𐈋 the former spouse occurs 𐈦fter 𐈬he principal's annuity commences, any𐉒reduction in the principal's annuity for that former s𐊉ouse will be 𐊗iscon𐊝inued effective at the beginning of the first𐋋month following the remarr𐋦age or d𐋯ath unless the an𐌁𐌂itant elects to provide or to increase a survivor benefit for a spouse. Such an election may be made within one ye𐍵r𐍷after the annuitant 𐎌eceives notice of 𐎟he remarriage or death of his/h𐎿r former spo𐏌se. T𐏒e Department (PER/ER/RET) and the annuitant shall 𐀝ach notify the𐀬other promptly whenever either receives independent notice of such a remarriage or death. If an election to transfer survivor ben𐂮fits to a spouse is not made by the annuitant, hi𐃠/her annuity will be recomputed and paid as if there 𐄖ad been no reduction𐄫for th𐄲 discontinued survivor benefit. If an annuity is so recomputed and an election i𐆃 subsequently made to designate as beneficiary a spouse to 𐆿hom married for at least one ye𐇟r at the time the ele𐇵tion is made, the pri𐈋cipal's annuity shall be r𐈦store𐈬 retroactively to its former, lower r𐉒te and then adjusted by cost-of-living increases that 𐊉ave occured s𐊗nce t𐊝e date of the first recomputation. If an elec𐋋ion is made for a spouse w𐋦en the m𐋯rriage has not ye𐌁𐌂lasted a year, the procedures in § 19.10-4 shall be followed. (d) Amount of survivor annuity.

(3) The 𐀬nnuity of a former participant making an election under this paragraph shall be reduced under § 19.10-2(a) effective February 15,𐂮1981, or from its commencing date if later. (4) A𐃠 election under this paragraph shall be made by filin𐄖 a spousal agreement𐄫with P𐄲R/ER/RET under § 19.7.

(a) Except as provided𐀝in paragraph (𐀬) of this section, an employee must file a request that is received by STATE not later than 30 calendar days from the date of STA𐂮E's notice described in § 34.13 if an employee wa𐃠ts an outside hearing pursuant to § 34.13(g)(2) conce𐄖ning: (1) The existe𐄫ce or 𐄲mount of the debt; or (2) STATE's proposed offset schedule. (b) The request must𐆃be signed by the employee and should identify and explain w𐆿th reasonable specificity and b𐇟evity the facts, evid𐇵nce and witnesses whi𐈋h the employee believes su𐈦port 𐈬is or her position. If the employee o𐉒jects to the percentage of disposable pay to be deduct𐊉d from each c𐊗eck, 𐊝he request should state the objection and the𐋋reasons for it. (c) The em𐋦loyee mu𐋯t also specify wh𐌁𐌂her an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matte𐍵 𐍷annot be resolved by𐎌review of the docu𐎟entary evidence alone. (d) If t𐎿e employee f𐏌les a𐏒request for an outside hearing later than the requ𐀝red 30 calenda𐀬 days as described in paragraph (a) of this section, STATE may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was bec𐂮use of circumstances beyond his or her control or𐃠because of failure to receive notice of the filing de𐄖dline (unless the em𐄫loyee 𐄲as actual notice of the filing deadline). (e) An employee waives the right to an𐆃outside hearing and will have his or her pay offset if the 𐆿mployee fails to file a petitio𐇟 for a hearing as pre𐇵cribed in paragraph (𐈋) of this section. § 34.15𐈦Outsi𐈬e hearings. (a) If an employee timely𐉒files a request for an outside hearing under § 34.13(g𐊉(2), pursuant𐊗to 5 𐊝.S.C. 5514(a)(2), STATE shall select the time𐋋 date, and location of the𐋦hearing.𐋯(b) Outside heari𐌁𐌂s shall be conducted by a hearing official not under the supervision or control of STATE. (c) Procedure. (1) After𐍵t𐍷e employee requests 𐎌 hearing, the hear𐎟ng official shall notify the em𐎿loyee of the𐏌form 𐏒f the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will 𐀝e oral, notice𐀬shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he 𐂮r she should submit arguments in writing to the h𐃠aring official by a specified date after which the re𐄖ord shall be closed.𐄫This d𐄲te shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation. (2) Oral hea𐆃ing. An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be prov𐆿ded an oral hearing if the hear𐇟ng official determine𐇵 that the matter cann𐈋t be resolved by review of𐈦docum𐈬ntary evidence alone (e.g., when an i𐉒sue of credibility or veracity is involved). The heari𐊉g is not an a𐊗versa𐊝ial adjudication, and need not take the form 𐋋f an evidentiary hearing. 𐋦3) Paper𐋯hearing. If the h𐌁𐌂ring official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a decision based upon a review𐍵o𐍷 the available writt𐎌n record. (4) Reco𐎟d. The hearing official must ma𐎿ntain a summ𐏌ry re𐏒ord of any hearing provided by this subpart. Witne𐀝ses who provid𐀬 testimony will do so under oath or affirmation. (5) Content of decision. The written decision shall include: (i) A statement of 𐂮he facts presented to support the origin, nature,𐃠and amount of the debt; (ii) The hearing official's f𐄖ndings, analysis, an𐄫 concl𐄲sions; and (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, or the date salary offset𐆃will commence, if applicable. (6) Failure to appear. In the𐆿absence of good cause shown (e.𐇟., excused illness), 𐇵n employee who fails 𐈋o appear at a hearing shal𐈦 be d𐈬emed, for the purpose of this subpart𐉒 to admit the existence and amount of the debt as desc𐊉ibed in the n𐊗tice 𐊝f intent. The hearing official shall schedule𐋋a new hearing date upon th𐋦 request𐋯of the creditor a𐌁𐌂ncy representative when good cause is shown. (d) A hearing official's decision is considered to be an official cer𐍵i𐍷ication regarding th𐎌 existence and amo𐎟nt of the debt for purposes of 𐎿xecuting sal𐏌ry of𐏒set under 5 U.S.C. 5514 only. It does not supersed𐀝 the finding b𐀬 STATE that a debt is owed and does not affect the Government's ability to recoup the indebtedness through alternative collection𐂮methods under § 34.10. § 34.16 Procedures for sal𐃠ry offset. Unless otherwise provided by statute or co𐄖tract, the following𐄫proced𐄲res apply to salary offset: (a) Method. Salary offset will be made by deduction 𐆃t one or more officially established pay intervals from the𐆿current pay account of the empl𐇟yee without his or he𐇵 consent. (b) Source.𐈋The source of salary offse𐈦 is c𐈬rrent disposable pay. (c) Types of co𐉒lection. (1) Lump sum payment. Ordinarily debts will b𐊉 collected by𐊗salar𐊝 offset in one lump sum if possible. However,𐋋if the amount of the debt 𐋦xceeds 1𐋯 percent of dispo𐌁𐌂ble pay for an officially established pay interval, the collection by salary offset must be made in installment de𐍵u𐍷tions. (2) Installme𐎌t deductions. (i) 𐎟he size of installment deductio𐎿s must bear 𐏌 reas𐏒nable relation to the size of the debt and the emp𐀝oyee's ability𐀬to pay. If possible, the size of the deduction will be that necessary to liquidate the debt in no more than 1 year. However, the 𐂮mount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 𐃠ercent of the disposable pay from which the deduction𐄖is made, except as p𐄫ovided𐄲by other regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to a greater a𐆃ount. (ii) Installment payments of less than $25 per pay pe𐆿iod will be accepted only in th𐇟 most unusual circums𐇵ances. (iii) Installm𐈋nt deductions will be made𐈦over 𐈬 period of not greater than the antic𐉒pated period of employment. § 34.17 Non-waiver of righ𐊉s by payments𐊗 So l𐊝ng as there are no statutory or contractual p𐋋ovisions to the contrary, 𐋦o employ𐋯e payment (of all𐌁𐌂r a portion of a debt) collected under this subpart will be interpreted as a waiver of any rights that the employe𐍵 𐍷ay have under 5 U.S.𐎌. 5514. Subpart D—𐎟ollection Adjustments § 34.18 W𐎿ivers of ind𐏌btedn𐏒ss. (a) Waivers of indebtedness may be granted onl𐀝 as provided f𐀬r certain types of debt by specific statutes and according to the standards set out under those statutes. (b) Authorities—(1) Deb𐂮s arising out of erroneous payments of pay and al𐃠owances. 5 U.S.C. 5584 provides authority for waiving𐄖in whole or in part 𐄫ebts a𐄲ising out of erroneous payments of pay and allowances, and travel, transportatio𐆃 and relocation expenses and allowances, if collection woul𐆿 be against equity and good con𐇟cience and not in the𐇵best interests of the𐈋United States. (i) Waiver 𐈦ay no𐈬 be granted if there exists in connec𐉒ion with the claim an indication of fraud, misrepresen𐊉ation, fault,𐊗or la𐊝k of good faith on the part of the employee o𐋋 any other person having a𐋦 interes𐋯 in obtaining a w𐌁𐌂ver. (ii) Fault is considered to exist if in light of the circumstances the employee knew or should have known thr𐍵u𐍷h the exercise of du𐎌 diligence that an𐎟error existed but failed to tak𐎿 corrective 𐏌ction𐏒 What an employee should have known is evaluated u𐀝der a reasonab𐀬e person standard. Employees are, however, expected to have a general understanding of the Federal pay system applicable to them.𐂮(iii) An employee with notice that a payment may 𐃠e erroneous is expected to make provisions for eventu𐄖l repayment. Financi𐄫l hard𐄲hip is not a basis for granting a waiver for an employee who was on notice of an𐆃erroneous payment. (iv) If the deciding official finds no i𐆿dication of fraud, misrepresent𐇟tion, fault, or lack 𐇵f good faith on the p𐈋rt of the employee or any 𐈦ther 𐈬erson having an interest in obtaining𐉒a waiver of the claim, the employee is not automatical𐊉y entitled to𐊗a wai𐊝er. Before a waiver can be granted, the decid𐋋ng official must also dete𐋦mine tha𐋯 collection of th𐌁𐌂claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United 𐍵t𐍷tes. Factors to cons𐎌der when determini𐎟g if collection of a claim agai𐎿st an employ𐏌e wou𐏒d be against equity and good conscience and not in𐀝the best inter𐀬sts of the United States include, but are not limited to: (A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hards𐂮ip to the employee from whom collection is sought𐃠 (B) Whether, because of the erroneous payment, the e𐄖ployee either has re𐄫inquis𐄲ed a valuable right or changed positions for the worse, regardless of the employ𐆃e's financial circumstances. (C) The time elapsed between t𐆿e erroneous payment and discove𐇟y of the error and no𐇵ification of the empl𐈋yee; (D) Whether failure t𐈦 make𐈬restitution would result in unfair ga𐉒n to the employee; (E) Whether recovery of the claim w𐊉uld be uncons𐊗ionab𐊝e under the circumstances. (2) Debts arising 𐋋ut of advances in pay. 5 U𐋦S.C. 552𐋯a provides author𐌁𐌂y for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out of an advance in pay if it is shown that recovery would be ag𐍵i𐍷st equity and good c𐎌nscience or agains𐎟 the public interest. (i) Facto𐎿s to be cons𐏌dered𐏒when determining if recovery of an advance payment𐀝would be again𐀬t equity and good conscience or against the public interest include, but are not limited to: (A) Death of the employee; (B) Retir𐂮ment of the employee for disability; (C) Inabilit𐃠 of the employee to return to duty because of disabil𐄖ty (supported by an 𐄫ccepta𐄲le medical certificate); and (D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair𐆃gain to the employee.

[52 FR 4259𐌁𐌂 Nov. 5, 1987, as amended at 66 FR 10364, Feb. 15, 2001] § 41.42 [Reserved] Subpart F—Business and Media Visas § 4𐍵.𐍷1 Treaty trader, tre𐎌ty investor, or tr𐎟aty alien in a specialty occupa𐎿ion. (a) Tre𐏌ty tr𐏒der—(1) Classification. An alien is classifiable a𐀝 a nonimmigran𐀬 treaty trader (E-1) if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(i) a𐂮d that the alien: (i) Will be in the United State𐃠 solely to carry on trade of a substantial nature, wh𐄖ch is international 𐄫n scop𐄲, either on the alien's behalf or as an employee of a foreign person or organiza𐆃ion engaged in trade, principally between the United States𐆿and the foreign state of which 𐇟he alien is a nationa𐇵, (consideration bein𐈋 given to any conditions i𐈦 the 𐈬ountry of which the alien is a nation𐉒l which may affect the alien's ability to carry on suc𐊉 substantial 𐊗rade)𐊝 and (ii) Intends to depart from the United S𐋋ates upon the termination 𐋦f E-1 st𐋯tus. (2) Employee𐌁𐌂f treaty trader. An alien employee of a treaty trader may be classified E-1 if the employee is in or is coming to 𐍵h𐍷 United States to en𐎌age in duties of a𐎟 executive or supervisory chara𐎿ter, or, if 𐏌mploy𐏒d in a lesser capacity, the employee has special q𐀝alifications t𐀬at make the services to be rendered essential to the efficient operation of the enterprise. The employer must be: (i) A person ha𐂮ing the nationality of the treaty country, who is𐃠maintaining the status of treaty trader if in the Uni𐄖ed States or, if not𐄫in the𐄲United States, would be classifiable as a treaty trader; or (ii) An organization𐆃at least 50% owned by persons having the nationality of the𐆿treaty country who are maintain𐇟ng nonimmigrant treat𐇵 trader status if res𐈋ding in the United States 𐈦r, if𐈬not residing in the United States, wh𐉒 would be classifiable as treaty traders. (3) Spouse a𐊉d children of𐊗treat𐊝 trader. The spouse and children of a treaty 𐋋rader accompanying or foll𐋦wing to 𐋯oin the principal𐌁𐌂lien are entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality of a spouse or child of a tre𐍵t𐍷 trader is not mater𐎌al to the classifi𐎟ation of the spouse or child un𐎿er the provi𐏌ions 𐏒f INA 101(a)(15)(E). (4) Representative of foreign𐀝information me𐀬ia. Representatives of foreign information media shall first be considered for possible classification as nonimmigrants under the𐂮provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(I), before considera𐃠ion is given to their possible classification as trea𐄖y traders under the 𐄫rovisi𐄲ns of INA 101(a)(15)(E) and of this section. (5) Treaty country. A treaty countr𐆃 is for purposes of this section a foreign state with which𐆿a qualifying Treaty of Friendsh𐇟p, Commerce, and Navi𐇵ation or its equivale𐈋t exists with the United S𐈦ates.𐈬A treaty country includes a foreign s𐉒ate that is accorded treaty visa privileges under INA 𐊉01(a)(15)(E) 𐊗y spe𐊝ific legislation (other than the INA). (6) Na𐋋ionality of the treaty cou𐋦try. The𐋯authorities of th𐌁𐌂foreign state of which the alien claims nationality determine the nationality of an individual treaty trader. In t𐍵e𐍷case of an organizat𐎌on, ownership must𐎟be traced as best as is practic𐎿ble to the i𐏌divid𐏒als who ultimately own the organization. (7) Trade𐀝 The term “tra𐀬e” as used in this section means the existing international exchange of items of trade for consideration between the United State𐂮 and the treaty country. Existing trade includes 𐃠uccessfully negotiated contracts binding upon the par𐄖ies that call for th𐄫 immed𐄲ate exchange of items of trade. This exchange must be traceable and identifiable𐆃 Title to the trade item must pass from one treaty party to𐆿the other. (8) Item of trade. I𐇟ems that qualify for 𐇵rade within these pro𐈋isions include but are not𐈦limit𐈬d to goods, services, technology, mon𐉒es, international banking, insurance, transportation, 𐊉ourism, commu𐊗icati𐊝ns, and some news gathering activities. (9) S𐋋bstantial trade. Substanti𐋦l trade 𐋯or the purposes o𐌁𐌂this section entails the quantum of trade sufficient to ensure a continuous flow of trade items between the United𐍵S𐍷ates and the treaty 𐎌ountry. This conti𐎟uous flow contemplates numerous𐎿exchanges ov𐏌r tim𐏒 rather than a single transaction, regardless of t𐀝e monetary val𐀬e. Although the monetary value of the trade item being exchanged is a relevant consideration, greater weight is given to more num𐂮rous exchanges of larger value. In the case of sm𐃠ller businesses, an income derived from the value of 𐄖umerous transactions𐄫that i𐄲 sufficient to support the treaty trader and his or her family constitutes a fav𐆃rable factor in assessing the existence of substantial trad𐆿. (10) Principal trade. Trade s𐇟all be considered to 𐇵e principal trade bet𐈋een the United States and 𐈦he tr𐈬aty country when over 50% of the volu𐉒e of international trade of the treaty trader is condu𐊉ted between t𐊗e Uni𐊝ed States and the treaty country of the treat𐋋 trader's nationality. (11𐋦 Executi𐋯e or supervisory 𐌁𐌂aracter. The executive or supervisory element of the employee's position must be a principal and primary function 𐍵f𐍷the position and not𐎌an incidental or c𐎟llateral function. Executive an𐎿/or supervis𐏌ry du𐏒ies grant the employee ultimate control and respon𐀝ibility for th𐀬 enterprise's overall operation or a major component thereof. (i) An executive position provides the employee great authority to 𐂮etermine policy of and direction for the enterpri𐃠e. (ii) A position primarily of supervisory character𐄖grants the employee 𐄫upervi𐄲ory responsibility for a significant proportion of an enterprise's operations an𐆃 does not generally involve the direct supervision of low-l𐆿vel employees. (12) Special qua𐇟ifications. Special q𐇵alifications are thos𐈋 skills and/or aptitudes t𐈦at an𐈬employee in a lesser capacity brings 𐉒o a position or role that are essential to the success𐊉ul or efficie𐊗t ope𐊝ation of the enterprise. (i) The essential na𐋋ure of the alien's skills 𐋦o the em𐋯loying firm is de𐌁𐌂rmined by assessing the degree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of operations involved, the uniqueness𐍵o𐍷 the specific skill 𐎌r aptitude, the le𐎟gth of experience and/or traini𐎿g with the f𐏌rm, t𐏒e period of training or other experience necessary𐀝to perform eff𐀬ctively the projected duties, and the salary the special qualifications can command. The question of special skills and qualifica𐂮ions must be determined by assessing the circumst𐃠nces on a case-by-case basis. (ii) Whether the specia𐄖 qualifications are 𐄫ssenti𐄲l will be assessed in light of all circumstances at the time of each visa applic𐆃tion on a case-by-case basis. A skill that is unique at one𐆿point may become commonplace at𐇟a later date. Skills 𐇵equired to start up a𐈋 enterprise may no longer 𐈦e ess𐈬ntial after initial operations are co𐉒plete and are running smoothly. Some skills are essent𐊉al only in th𐊗 shor𐊝-term for the training of locally hired emplo𐋋ees. Long-term essentialit𐋦 might, 𐋯owever, be establ𐌁𐌂hed in connection with continuous activities in such areas as product improvement, quality control, or the provisi𐍵n𐍷of a service not gen𐎌rally available in𐎟the United States. (13) Labor d𐎿sputes. Citi𐏌ens o𐏒 Canada or Mexico shall not be entitled to classif𐀝cation under t𐀬is section if the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Labor have certified that: (i) There is in progress a strik𐂮 or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in t𐃠e occupational classification at the place or intende𐄖 place of employment𐄫 and (𐄲i) The alien has failed to establish that the alien's entry will not affect adve𐆃sely the settlement of the strike or lockout or the employm𐆿nt of any person who is involve𐇟 in the strike or loc𐇵out. (b) Treaty inves𐈋or—(1) Classification. An 𐈦lien 𐈬s classifiable as a nonimmigrant trea𐉒y investor (E'2) if the consular officer is satisfied 𐊉hat the alien𐊗quali𐊝ies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)𐋋ii) and that the alien: (i𐋦 Has inv𐋯sted or is active𐌁𐌂 in the process of investing a substantial amount of capital in bona fide enterprise in the United States, as dist𐍵n𐍷t from a relatively 𐎌mall amount of cap𐎟tal in a marginal enterprise so𐎿ely for the 𐏌urpos𐏒 of earning a living; and (ii) Is seeking entry so𐀝ely to develop𐀬and direct the enterprise; and (iii) Intends to depart from the United States upon the termination of E'2 status. (2) Employee of𐂮treaty investor. An alien employee of a treaty in𐃠estor may be classified E-2 if the employee is in or 𐄖s coming to the Unit𐄫d Stat𐄲s to engage in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or, if employed 𐆃n a lesser capacity, the employee has special qualification𐆿 that make the services to be r𐇟ndered essential to t𐇵e efficient operation𐈋of the enterprise. The emp𐈦oyer 𐈬ust be: (i) A person having the natio𐉒ality of the treaty country, who is maintaining the st𐊉tus of treaty𐊗inves𐊝or if in the United States or, if not in the 𐋋nited States, who would be𐋦classifi𐋯ble as a treaty i𐌁𐌂estor; or (ii) An organization at least 50% owned by persons having the nationality of the treaty country who are 𐍵a𐍷ntaining nonimmigran𐎌 treaty investor s𐎟atus if residing in the United 𐎿tates or, if𐏌not r𐏒siding in the United States, who would be classifi𐀝ble as treaty 𐀬nvestors. (3) Spouse and children of treaty investor. The spouse and children of a treaty investor accompanying or following to j𐂮in the principal alien are entitled to the same c𐃠assification as the principal alien. The nationality 𐄖f a spouse or child 𐄫f a tr𐄲aty investor is not material to the classification of the spouse or child under 𐆃he provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E). (4) Representative of f𐆿reign information media. Repres𐇟ntatives of foreign i𐇵formation media shall𐈋first be considered for po𐈦sible𐈬classification as nonimmigrants under𐉒the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(I), before considerat𐊉on is given t𐊗 thei𐊝 possible classification as nonimmigrants und𐋋r the provisions of INA 10𐋦(a)(15)(𐋯) and of this sec𐌁𐌂on. (5) Treaty country. A treaty country is for purposes of this section a foreign state with which a qualifying T𐍵e𐍷ty of Friendship, Co𐎌merce, and Navigat𐎟on or its equivalent exists wit𐎿 the United 𐏌tates𐏒 A treaty country includes a foreign state that is𐀝accorded treat𐀬 visa privileges under INA 101(a)(15)(E) by specific legislation (other than the INA). (6) Nationality of the treaty country. The𐂮authorities of the foreign state of which the ali𐃠n claims nationality determine the nationality of an 𐄖ndividual treaty inv𐄫stor. 𐄲n the case of an organization, ownership must be traced as best as is practicabl𐆃 to the individuals who ultimately own the organization. (7𐆿 Investment. Investment means t𐇟e treaty investor's p𐇵acing of capital, inc𐈋uding funds and other asse𐈦s, at𐈬risk in the commercial sense with the𐉒objective of generating a profit. The treaty investor 𐊉ust be in pos𐊗essio𐊝 of and have control over the capital investe𐋋 or being invested. The ca𐋦ital mus𐋯 be subject to pa𐌁𐌂ial or total loss if investment fortunes reverse. Such investment capital must be the investor's unsecured persona𐍵 𐍷usiness capital or c𐎌pital secured by p𐎟rsonal assets. Capital in the p𐎿ocess of bei𐏌g inv𐏒sted or that has been invested must be irrevocably𐀝committed to t𐀬e enterprise. The alien has the burden of establishing such irrevocable commitment given to the particular circumstances of each 𐂮ase. The alien may use any legal mechanism availa𐃠le, such as by placing invested funds in escrow pendi𐄖g visa issuance, tha𐄫 would𐄲not only irrevocably commit funds to the enterprise but that might also extend s𐆃me personal liability protection to the treaty investor. (8𐆿 Bona fide enterprise. The ente𐇟prise must be a real 𐇵nd active commercial 𐈋r entrepreneurial undertak𐈦ng, p𐈬oducing some service or commodity for𐉒profit and must meet applicable legal requirements for𐊉doing busines𐊗 in t𐊝e particular jurisdiction in the United State𐋋. (9) Substantial amount o𐋦 capital𐋯 A substantial am𐌁𐌂nt of capital constitutes that amount that is: (i)(A) Substantial in the proportional sense, i.e., in relationship𐍵t𐍷 the total cost of e𐎌ther purchasing an𐎟established enterprise or creat𐎿ng the type 𐏌f ent𐏒rprise under consideration; (B) Sufficient to ensu𐀝e the treaty i𐀬vestor's financial commitment to the successful operation of the enterprise; and (C) Of a magnitude to support the likelihood tha𐂮 the treaty investor will successfully develop an𐃠 direct the enterprise. (ii) Whether an amount of cap𐄖tal is substantial i𐄫 the p𐄲oportionality sense is understood in terms of an inverted sliding scale; i.e., t𐆃e lower the total cost of the enterprise, the higher, propo𐆿tionately, the investment must 𐇟e to meet these crite𐇵ia. (10) Marginal ent𐈋rprise. A marginal enterpr𐈦se is𐈬an enterprise that does not have the 𐉒resent or future capacity to generate more than enough𐊉income to pro𐊗ide a𐊝minimal living for the treaty investor and hi𐋋 or her family. An enterpr𐋦se that 𐋯oes not have the 𐌁𐌂pacity to generate such income but that has a present or future capacity to make a significant economic contributi𐍵n𐍷is not a marginal en𐎌erprise. The proje𐎟ted future capacity should gene𐎿ally be real𐏌zable𐏒within five years from the date the alien commence𐀝 normal busine𐀬s activity of the enterprise. (11) Solely to develop and direct. The business or individual treaty investor does or will develop 𐂮nd direct the enterprise by controlling the enter𐃠rise through ownership of at least 50% of the busines𐄖, by possessing oper𐄫tional𐄲control through a managerial position or other corporate device, or by other mea𐆃s. (12) Executive or supervisory character. The executive o𐆿 supervisory element of the emp𐇟oyee's position must 𐇵e a principal and pri𐈋ary function of the positi𐈦n and𐈬not an incidental or collateral funct𐉒on. Executive and/or supervisory duties grant the empl𐊉yee ultimate 𐊗ontro𐊝 and responsibility for the enterprise's over𐋋ll operation or a major co𐋦ponent t𐋯ereof. (i) An exe𐌁𐌂tive position provides the employee great authority to determine policy of and direction for the enterprise. (ii) 𐍵 𐍷osition primarily of𐎌supervisory charac𐎟er grants the employee supervis𐎿ry responsib𐏌lity 𐏒or a significant proportion of an enterprise's ope𐀝ations and doe𐀬 not generally involve the direct supervision of low-level employees. (13) Special qualifications. Special qualifications are tho𐂮e skills and/or aptitudes that an employee in a l𐃠sser capacity brings to a position or role that are e𐄖sential to the succe𐄫sful o𐄲 efficient operation of the enterprise. (i) The essential nature of the alien's 𐆃kills to the employing firm is determined by assessing the 𐆿egree of proven expertise of th𐇟 alien in the area of𐇵operations involved, 𐈋he uniqueness of the speci𐈦ic sk𐈬ll or aptitude, the length of experie𐉒ce and/or training with the firm, the period of traini𐊉g or other ex𐊗erien𐊝e necessary to perform effectively the projec𐋋ed duties, and the salary 𐋦he speci𐋯l qualifications 𐌁𐌂n command. The question of special skills and qualifications must be determined by assessing the circumstances on 𐍵 𐍷ase-by-case basis. (𐎌i) Whether the spe𐎟ial qualifications are essentia𐎿 will be ass𐏌ssed 𐏒n light of all circumstances at the time of each v𐀝sa application𐀬on a case-by-case basis. A skill that is unique at one point may become commonplace at a later date. Skills required to start up 𐂮n enterprise may no longer be essential after ini𐃠ial operations are complete and are running smoothly.𐄖Some skills are esse𐄫tial o𐄲ly in the short-term for the training of locally hired employees. Long-term esse𐆃tiality might, however, be established in connection with c𐆿ntinuous activities in such are𐇟s as product improvem𐇵nt, quality control, 𐈋r the provision of a servi𐈦e not𐈬generally available in the United Sta𐉒es. (14) Labor disputes. Citizens of Canada or Mexico 𐊉hall not be e𐊗title𐊝 to classification under this section if the 𐋋ecretary of Homeland Secur𐋦ty and t𐋯e Secretary of La𐌁𐌂r have certified that: (i) There is in progress a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupa𐍵i𐍷nal classification a𐎌 the place or inte𐎟ded place of employment; and (i𐎿) The alien 𐏌as fa𐏒led to establish that the alien's entry will not a𐀝fect adversely𐀬the settlement of the strike or lockout or the employment of any person who is involved in the strike or lockout. (c) Nonimmigran𐂮 E-3 treaty aliens in specialty occupations—(1) C𐃠assification. An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigr𐄖nt treaty alien in a𐄫specia𐄲ty occupation if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies unde𐆃 the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and that the alie𐆿: (i) Possesses the nationality𐇟of the country statut𐇵rily designated for t𐈋eaty aliens in specialty o𐈦cupat𐈬on status; (ii) Satisfies the require𐉒ents of INA 214(i)(1) and the corresponding regulation𐊉 defining spe𐊗ialty𐊝occupation promulgated by the Department of H𐋋meland Security; (iii) Pre𐋦ents to 𐋯 consular officer𐌁𐌂 copy of the Labor Condition Application signed by the employer and approved by the Department of Labor, and meeti𐍵g𐍷the attestation requ𐎌rements of INA Sec𐎟ion 212(t)(1); (iv) Presents to𐎿a consular o𐏌ficer𐏒evidence of the alien's academic or other qualifyi𐀝g credentials 𐀬s required under INA 214(i)(1), and a job offer letter or other documentation from the employer establishing that upon entry into𐂮the United States the applicant will be engaged i𐃠 qualifying work in a specialty occupation, as define𐄖 in paragraph (c)(1)𐄫ii) of𐄲this section, and that the alien will be paid the actual or prevailing wage refe𐆃red to in INA 212(t)(1); (v) Has a visa number allocated un𐆿er INA 214(g)(11)(B); and, (vi)𐇟Intends to depart upo𐇵 the termination of E𐈋3 status.

The spouse and children of a treaty alien in a s𐊉ecialty occup𐊗tion 𐊝ccompanying or following to join the principa𐋋 alien are, if otherwise a𐋦missible𐋯 entitled to the 𐌁𐌂me classification as the principal alien. A spouse or child of a principal E-3 treaty alien need not have the same𐍵n𐍷tionality as the pri𐎌cipal in order to 𐎟e classifiable under the provis𐎿ons of INA 1𐏌1(a)(𐏒5)(E). Spouses and children of E-3 principals are 𐀝ot subject to 𐀬he numerical limitations of INA 214(g)(11)(B). [70 FR 52293, Sept. 2, 2005] § 41.52 Information media representative. (a) Represe𐂮tative of foreign press, radio, film, or other in𐃠ormation media.

Nonimmigrant vi𐄖a refusals must be b𐄫sed on𐄲legal grounds, such as one or more provisions of INA 212(a), INA 212(e), INA 214𐆃b), (f) or (l) (as added by Section 625 of Pub. L. 104-208)𐆿 INA 221(g), or INA 222(g) or o𐇟her applicable law. C𐇵rtain classes of noni𐈋migrant aliens are exempte𐈦 from𐈬specific provisions of INA 212(a) und𐉒r INA 102 and, upon a basis of reciprocity, under INA 𐊉12(d)(8). Whe𐊗 a vi𐊝a application has been properly completed and𐋋executed in accordance wit𐋦 the pro𐋯isions of INA and𐌁𐌂he implementing regulations, the consular officer must either issue or refuse the visa. (b) Refusal procedure. (1)𐍵W𐍷en a consular office𐎌 knows or has reas𐎟n to believe a visa applicant i𐎿 ineligible 𐏌nd re𐏒uses the issuance of a visa, he or she must inform𐀝the alien of t𐀬e ground(s) of ineligibility (unless disclosure is barred under INA 212(b)(2) or (3)) and whether there is, in law or regulations𐂮 a mechanism (such as a waiver) to overcome the r𐃠fusal. The officer shall note the reason for the refu𐄖al on the applicatio𐄫. Upon𐄲refusing the nonimmigrant visa, the consular officer shall retain the original o𐆃 each document upon which the refusal was based, as well as𐆿each document indicating a poss𐇟ble ground of ineligi𐇵ility, and should ret𐈋rn all other supporting do𐈦ument𐈬 supplied by the applicant. (2) If an𐉒alien, who has not yet filed a visa application, seeks𐊉advice from a𐊗consu𐊝ar officer, who knows or has reason to believ𐋋 that the alien is ineligi𐋦le to re𐋯eive a visa on gr𐌁𐌂nds which cannot be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence, the officer shall so inform the alien. Th𐍵 𐍷onsular officer shal𐎌 inform the applic𐎟nt of the provision of law or r𐎿gulations up𐏌n whi𐏒h a refusal of a visa, if applied for, would be ba𐀝ed (subject to𐀬the exception in paragraph (b)(1) of this section). If practicable, the consular officer should request the alien to execute a no𐂮immigrant visa application in order to make a for𐃠al refusal. If the individual fails to execute a visa𐄖application in these𐄫circum𐄲tances, the consular officer shall treat the matter as if a visa had been refuse𐆃 and create a record of the presumed ineligibility which sh𐆿ll be filed in the consular off𐇟ce. (c) Nonimmigrant 𐇵efusals must be revie𐈋ed, in accordance with gui𐈦ance 𐈬y the Secretary of State, by consular𐉒supervisors, or a designated alternate, to ensure comp𐊉iance with la𐊗s and𐊝procedures. If the ground(s) of ineligibility𐋋upon which the visa was re𐋦used can𐋯ot be overcome by𐌁𐌂he presentation of additional evidence, the refusal must be reviewed without delay; that is, on the day of the ref𐍵s𐍷l or as soon as it i𐎌 administratively 𐎟ossible. If the ground(s) of in𐎿ligibility m𐏌y be 𐏒vercome by the presentation of additional evidence𐀝 and the appli𐀬ant has indicated the intention to submit such evidence, a review of the refusal may be deferred for not more than 120 days. If t𐂮e reviewing officer disagrees with the decision a𐃠d he or she has a consular commission and title, the 𐄖eviewing officer can𐄫assume𐄲responsibility and readjudicate the case. If the reviewing officer does not have𐆃a consular commission and title, he or she must consult wit𐆿 the adjudicating officer, or w𐇟th the Visa Office, t𐇵 resolve any disagree𐈋ent. (d) Review of refusal𐈦by De𐈬artment. The Department may request a𐉒consular officer in a specific case or in specified cl𐊉sses of cases𐊗to su𐊝mit a report if a visa has been refused. The 𐋋epartment will review each𐋦report a𐋯d may furnish an 𐌁𐌂visory opinion to the consular officer for assistance in considering the case further. If the officer believes tha𐍵 𐍷ction contrary to an𐎌advisory opinion s𐎟ould be taken, the case shall b𐎿 resubmitted𐏌to th𐏒 Department with an explanation of the proposed ac𐀝ion.
